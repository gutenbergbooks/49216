  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This work does not treat of the origin of man’s
religious faculty, or of the origin of the sentiment of
religion; nor does it enter the domain of theological
discussion. It simply attempts to show the beginning
of religious rites, by which man evidenced a belief,
however obtained, in the possibility of covenant relations
between God and man; and the gradual development
of those rites, with the progress of the race
toward a higher degree of civilization and enlightenment.
Necessarily the volume is not addressed to a
popular audience, but to students in the lessons of
primitive life and culture.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a former volume, “The Blood Covenant,” I
sought to show the origin of sacrifice, and the significance
of transferred or proffered blood or life. The
facts given in that work have been widely accepted as
lying at the basis of fundamental doctrines declared
in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures, and have
also been recognized as the source of perverted views
which have had prominence in the principal ethnic religions
of the world. Scholars of as divergent schools
of thought as Professors William Henry Green of
<span class='pageno' title='iv' id='Page_iv'></span>Princeton, Charles A. Briggs of New York, George E.
Day of Yale, John A. Broadus of Louisville, Samuel
Ives Curtiss of Chicago, President Mark Hopkins of
Williams, Rev. Drs. Alfred Edersheim of Oxford and
Cunningham Geikie of Bournemouth, Professor Fréderic
Godet of Neuchatel, and many others, were agreed
in recognizing the freshness and importance of its
investigations, and the value of its conclusions. Professor
W. Robertson Smith, of Cambridge, in thanking
me for that work, expressed regret that he had not seen
it before writing his “Kinship and Marriage in Early
Arabia.” He afterwards made repeated mention of
the work as an authority in its field, in his Burnett
Lectures on the “Religion of the Semites.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This volume grew out of that one. It looks back
to a still earlier date. That began as it were with
Cain and Abel, while this begins with Adam and
Eve. It was while preparing a Supplement for a
second edition of that volume that the main idea of
this work assumed such importance in my mind that
I was led to make a separate study of it, and present
it independently. The special theory here advanced
is wholly a result of induction. The theory came
out of the gathered facts, instead of the facts being
gathered in support of the theory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, these facts are not new, but it is believed
that their synthetic arrangement is. It has been a
<span class='pageno' title='v' id='Page_v'></span>favorite method with students of primitive religions
to point out widely different objects of primitive
worship and their corresponding cults among different
peoples, and then to try to show how the ceremonials
of the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures were
made up from these primitive cults. But the course
of investigation here pursued seems to show that
the earlier cult was the simple one, which has been
developed in the line of the Bible story, and that
the other cults, even those baser and more degraded,
are only natural perversions of the original simple
one. This is a reversal of the usual order in studies
of primitive religious rites. Here it is first the
simple, then the complex; first the one germ, then
the many varieties of growth from that germ.</p>

<p class='c000'>As this particular subject of investigation seems to
be a hitherto untrodden field, I am unable to refer to
any published works as my principal sources of information.
But I have gathered important related
facts from various directions, giving full credit in explicit
foot-notes, page by page. Many added facts
confirmatory of my position might, undoubtedly, have
been found through yet wider and more discerning
research, and they will be brought to light by other
gleaners in the same field. Indeed, a chief value of
this volume will be in the fresh study it provokes on
the part of those whom it stimulates to more thorough
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>investigation in the direction here pointed out. And
if such study shows an added agreement between
some of the main facts of modern scientific investigation
and those disclosed in the Bible narrative, that
will not be a matter of regret to any fair-minded
scholar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In my earlier studies for this work, I had valuable
assistance from the late Mr. John T. Napier; and in
my later researches I have been materially assisted by
Professors Herman V. Hilprecht, E. Washburn Hopkins,
William R. Lamberton, John Henry Wright,
Robert Ellis Thompson, Morris Jastrow, Jr., D.G.
Brinton, Adolph Erman, W. Max Müller, W. Hayes
Ward, M.B. Riddle, Minton Warren, Alfred Gudeman,
John P. Peters, M.W. Easton, and A.L. Frothingham,
Jr., President George Washburn, Rev. Drs.
Marcus Jastrow, H.H. Jessup, George A. Ford, William
W. Eddy, and Benjamin Labaree, Rev. William
Ewing, Rev. Paulus Moort, Dr. Talcott Williams, Dr.
J. Solis Cohen, Dr. A.T. Clay, Dr. T.H. Powers
Sailer, Judge Mayer Sulzberger, Mr. S. Schecter, Mr.
Frank Hamilton Cushing, Captain John G. Bourke,
Mr. Khaleel Sarkis, Mr. John T. Haddad, Mr. Montague
Cockle, Mr. Le Roy Bliss Peckham, the late
Mr. William John Potts, and other specialists. To
all these I return my sincere thanks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Facts and suggestions that came to my notice after
<span class='pageno' title='vii' id='Page_vii'></span>the main work was completed, or that, while known
to me before, did not seem to have a place in the
direct presentation of the argument, have been given
a place in the Appendix. These may prove helpful
to scholars who would pursue the investigation beyond
my limits of treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Comments of eminent specialists in Europe and
America, to whom the proof-sheets of the volume
were submitted before publication, are given in a
Supplement. Important additions are thus made to
the results of my researches, which are sure to be
valued accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>1. A BLOOD WELCOME AT THE DOOR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The primitive altar of the family would seem to
have been the threshold, or door-sill, or entrance-way,
of the home dwelling-place. This is indicated
by surviving customs, in the East and elsewhere
among primitive peoples, and by the earliest historic
records of the human race. It is obvious that houses
preceded temples, and that the house-father was the
earliest priest. Sacrifices for the family were, therefore,
within or at the entrance of the family domicile.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Syria and in Egypt, at the present time, when
a guest who is worthy of special honor is to be welcomed
to a home, the blood of a slaughtered, or a
“sacrificed,” animal is shed on the threshold of that
home, as a means of adopting the new-comer into the
family, or of making a covenant union with him. And
every such primitive covenant in blood includes an
appeal to the protecting Deity to ratify it as between
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>the two parties and himself.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> While the guest
is still outside, the host takes a lamb, or a goat, and,
tying its feet together, lays it upon the threshold
of his door. Resting his left knee upon the bound
victim, the host holds its head by his left hand, while
with his right he cuts its throat. He retains his
position until all the blood has flowed from the body
upon the threshold. Then the victim is removed,
and the guest steps over the blood, across the threshold;
and in this act he becomes, as it were, a member
of the family by the Threshold Covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flesh of the slaughtered animal is usually given
to the neighbors, although in the case of humbler
persons it is sometimes used for the meal of the guest
in whose honor it is sacrificed. It may be a larger
offering than a lamb or a goat, or it may be a smaller
one. Sometimes several sheep are included in the
sacrifice. Again, the offering may be a bullock or a
heifer, or simply a fowl or a pair of pigeons. The more
costly the gift, in proportion to the means of the host,
the greater the honor to him who is welcomed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As illustrative of this idea, a story is commonly told
in Syria of a large-hearted man who gave proof of his
exceptional devotedness to an honored guest. He
had a horse which he prized as only an Oriental can
prize and love one. This horse he sent to meet his
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>guest, in order that it might bring him to the home
of its owner. When the guest reached the house and
dismounted, he spoke warm words in praise of the noble
animal. At once the host led the horse to the house
door, and cut its throat over the threshold, asking the
guest to step over the blood of this costly offering, in
acceptance of the proffered Threshold Covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you know that one is coming whom you would
honor and welcome, you must make ready to have
the blood on the threshold when he appears,” said a
native Syrian. In case an honored guest arrives unexpectedly,
so that there is no time to prepare the
customary sacrifice, salt, as representing blood, may
be sprinkled on the threshold, for the guest to pass
over; or again coffee, as the Muhammadan substitute
for the “blood of the grape,”<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> may be poured on it.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Crossing the threshold, or entering the door, of a
house, is in itself an implied covenant with those who
are within, as shown by the earlier laws of India. He
who goes in by the door must count himself, and
must be recognized, as a guest, subject to the strictest
laws of hospitality. But if he enters the house in
some other way, not crossing the threshold, there is
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>no such implied covenant on his part. He may then
even despoil or kill the head of the house he has
entered, without any breach of the law of hospitality,
or of the moral law as there understood.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Illustrations
of this truth are found in the Mahabharata,
as applicable to both a house and a city.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a> “It is in
accordance with the strict law of all the law books,”
of ancient India, “that one may enter his foe’s house
by <em>a-dvāra</em>, ‘not by door,’ but his friend’s house only
‘by door.’”<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem to have been in accordance with this
primitive law of the East that Jesus said: “He that
entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep,
but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief
and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is
the shepherd of the sheep.... I am the door: by me
if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in
and go out, and shall find pasture. The thief cometh
not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I
came that they may have life, and may have it
abundantly.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is possible that there is an explanation, in this
law of the doorway, or threshold, of the common
practice among primitive Scandinavians of attacking
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>the inmates of an enemy’s house through the roof
instead of by the door;<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> also, of the custom in Greece
of welcoming a victor in the Olympian games into his
city through a breach in the walls, instead of causing
him to enter by the gates, with its implied subjection
to all the laws of hospitality.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> (See <a href='#olympian'>Appendix</a>.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Examples of the blood welcome at the threshold
abound in modern Egyptian customs. When the new
khedive came to his palace, in 1882, a threshold sacrifice
was offered as his welcome. “At the entrance to
the palace six buffaloes were slaughtered, two being
killed just as the khedive’s carriage reached the gateway.
The blood of the animals was splashed across
the entrance, so that the horses’ hoofs and wheels of
the carriage passed through it. The flesh was afterwards
distributed among the poor.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When General Grant was at Assioot, on the Upper
Nile, during his journey around the world, he was
doubly welcomed as a guest by the American vice-consul,
who was a native of Egypt. A bullock was
sacrificed at the steamer landing, and its head was
laid on one side of the gang-plank, and its body on
the other. The outpoured blood was between the
head and the body, under the gang-plank, so that, in
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>stepping from the steamer to the shore, General Grant
would cross over it. When he reached the house of
the vice-consul, a sheep was similarly sacrificed at the
threshold, in such a way that General Grant passed
over the blood in entering.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is also said in Egypt: “If you buy a dahabiyeh,”
and therefore are to cross its threshold for the occupancy
of your new home on the water, “you must
kill a sheep, letting the blood flow on the deck, or
side, of the boat, in order that it may be lucky.
Your friends will afterwards have to dine on the
sheep.”<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> There seems, indeed, to be a survival of
this idea in the custom of “christening”  a ship at the
time of its launching, in England and America, a
bottle of wine–the “blood of the grape”<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a>–being
broken on the bow of the vessel as it crosses the
threshold of the deep. And a feast usually follows
this ceremony also.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Zindero, or Gingiro, or Zinder, in Central Africa,
a new king is welcomed at the royal residence with
a bloody threshold offering. “Before he enters his
palace two men are to be slain; one at the foot of
the tree by which his house is chiefly supported;
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>the other at the threshold of his door, which is
besmeared with the blood of the victim. And it is
said ... that the particular family, whose privilege
it is to be slaughtered, so far from avoiding it, glory
in the occasion, and offer themselves willingly to
meet it.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Arabs in Central Africa, the blood
welcome of a guest at the threshold of a home is a
prevailing custom. “The usual welcome upon the
arrival of a traveler, who is well received in an Arab
camp, is the sacrifice of a fat sheep, that should be
slaughtered at the door of the hut or tent, so that the
blood flows to the threshold.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the arrival of strangers among the primitive
tribes of Liberia, in West Africa, a fowl is killed, and
its blood is sprinkled at the doorway.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Receiving an honored guest with bread and salt, at
the threshold of the house he enters, is common in
Russia. Bread and salt are symbolic, in primitive
thought, of flesh and blood; and this threshold welcome
seems to be a survival of the threshold sacrifice.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To step over or across the blood, or its substitute,
on the door-sill, is to accept or ratify the proffered
covenant; but to trample upon the symbol of the
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>covenant is to show contempt for the host who proffers
it, and no greater indignity than this is known in
the realm of primitive social intercourse.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2.  REVERENCE FOR THE THRESHOLD ALTAR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The threshold, as the family altar on which the
sacrificial blood of a covenant welcome is poured out,
is counted sacred, and is not to be stepped upon, or
passed over lightly; but it is to be crossed over reverently,
as in recognition of Him to whom all life belongs.
“On passing the threshold,” in Arabia, “it is
proper to say, ‘Bismillah,’ that is, ‘In the name of
God.’ Not to do so would be looked upon as a bad
augury, alike for him who enters and for those
within.”<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> In Syria the belief prevails “that it is unlucky
to tread on a threshold.” When they receive
a new member to their sect, the Bektashi derwishes
of Syria bring him to the threshold, and prayers and
sacrifices are offered “on the door-sill.”<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“The khaleefs of Bagdad required all those who
entered their palace to prostrate themselves on the
threshold of the gate, where they had inserted a fragment
of the black stone of the temple at Meccah, in
order to render it [the threshold] more venerable
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>to those who had been accustomed to press their
foreheads against it. The threshold was of some
height, and it was a crime to set foot upon it.” In
the advice which Nurshivan gives to his son Hormuz,
he recommends him to betake himself to the threshold
of the Lord; that is, to the “presence of God,
in the same fashion in which the poor do, at the gates
of the rich. ‘Since you are his slave,’ he says, ‘set
your forehead on his threshold.’”<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Hindoos, “the threshold is ... sacred
in private houses; it is not propitious for a person to
remain on it; neither to eat, sneeze, yawn, nor spit
whilst there.”<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A double welcome is sometimes given to one who
is in an official position. Thus, a Syrian, who held a
commission from the chief officer of customs in Upper
Syria, was surprised at having two sheep sacrificed
before him as he approached the door of a house east
of the Sea of Galilee; and he graciously protested
against the excessive honor shown him. “One sheep
is to welcome yourself as a man, and the other is to
welcome you as an officer of the government,” was
the answer. Loyalty as well as hospitality was indicated
in these threshold sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sacredness attaches to the threshold in Persia. It
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>must not be trodden on; but it is often kissed by
those who would step over it.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A man should always cross himself when he steps
over a threshold in Russia; and, in some portions of
the realm, it is believed that he ought not to sit down
on the threshold.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c012'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>High sills, or thresholds, so that one must step
over, and not on, them, are in the houses of Finland,
and in the houses of many Finns in the United States.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c012'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
The same was true of many Teutonic houses.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>To shake hands across a threshold, instead of crossing
it, is said, in Finland, to ensure a quarrel.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> To
step over a threshold is, in Lapland, to bring one
under the protection of the family within, and of
its guardian deity.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> The same is true among the
Magyars.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The ancient Pythagoreans quoted various maxims,
supposed to be from the sayings of their great founder,
as teaching important lessons for all time. In these
maxims there were indications of a peculiar reverence
for the threshold and doorway. Thus: “He
who strikes his foot against the threshold should go
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>back;” it were unsafe to pursue a movement so inauspiciously
begun. And, again: “The doors should
be kissed fondly by those who enter or depart.”<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Treading on the threshold was ... tabooed by the
Tatars.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> Again, on the other side of the globe, in
Samoa, to spill water on the door-step, or threshold,
when food is brought in, is a cause of anger to the protecting
deity of the family. It may drive him away.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Europe and in America it is by many counted
an ill omen to tread upon the threshold of the door
on entering a house. To the present day, in portions
of Scotland, the idea popularly prevails, that to tread
directly upon the boundary lines of division between
ordinary flagstones is to endanger one’s soul; hence
the very children are careful to avoid stepping upon
those lines, in their walking across the courtyards or
along the streets, in their every-day passing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many a person in the United States, who knows
nothing of any superstition connected with this, avoids,
if possible, stepping on, instead of over, the cracks or
seams of a board walk, or even the seams of a carpet.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these customs seem to be a survival of the feeling
that the threshold is sacred as the primitive altar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>Apart from the reverence for the threshold demanded
of those who pass over it, there is an obvious
sanctity of the threshold recognized in the placing of
images and amulets underneath it, and in the sacrifices
and offerings placed on it, as a means of guarding the
dwelling within.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the building of private houses, as well as temples,
and city gateways, in ancient Assyria, images of
various kinds and sizes, “in bronze, red jasper, yellow
stone, and baked earth, ... are buried beneath the
stones of the threshold, so as to bar the entrance to
all destructive spirits.” Invocations are graven upon
these figures.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Herodotus mentions<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> that, in the annual feast in
honor of the god Osiris, “every Egyptian sacrifices a
hog before the door of his house” on the evening
before the festival. Osiris was the god who was the
judge of the soul after death, and who in a peculiar
sense stood for the truth of the life to come. Every
Egyptian desired, above all, to be in loving covenant
with Osiris, and when he would offer a welcoming
sacrifice to him, he did so before the door of his
own house, as before the primitive family altar. That
it was the <em>blood</em> poured out at the threshold which
was the essential act of covenanting in this sacrifice to
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>Osiris, is evidenced in the fact that the animal sacrificed
was not eaten in the family of the sacrificer, but
was carried away by the swineherd who furnished it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bunches of grass dipped in blood, and touched by
the king, as if made representative of his dignity and
power, are to-day placed on the threshold, as an offering,
and as averters of evil, in Equatorial Africa. This
is known there as an ancient custom. In Uganda,
“every house has charms hung on the door, and
others laid on the threshold.” An offering to the
<em>lubare</em>, or local spirit, must be thrown across the
threshold, from within the house, before a native
ventures to leave his home in the morning.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c012'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Charms
for this purpose are kept behind the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the requirements in the Vedic law (the sacred
law of the Hindoos) was, that “on the door-sill (a bali
must be placed) with a mantra addressed to Antariksha
(the air),”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c012'><sup>[36]</sup></a> by a house father, in his home;<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c012'><sup>[37]</sup></a> that is,
that an offering, with an invocation to a deity, should
be a sacrifice at the threshold altar. Other references
in the Hindoo laws seem to demand bali offerings
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>“at all the doors, as many as they are,” in a house,
and evidence the importance and sacredness attaching
to the doorway.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c012'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The threshold seems to have special reverence in
Northwestern India, in connection with the seasons
of seedtime and harvest. At seedtime “a cake of
cowdung formed into a cup” is placed on the threshold
of the householder; it is filled with corn, and
then water is poured over it as a libation to the deities.
Cowdung is not only a means of enrichment to
the soil, but it is a gift from the sacred cow, and so, in
a sense, represents or stands for the life of the cow.
It is laid on the threshold altar as an offering of life.
The libation of water is an accompaniment of that
offering; water is essential to life and growth, and it
is a gift of the gods accordingly. Seed-sowing is
recognized as an act which needs the blessing of the
gods, and on which that blessing is sought in covenant
relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>At early harvest time the first-fruits of the grain-field
are not taken to the threshing-floor, but are brought
home to be presented to the gods at the household
altar, and afterwards eaten by the family, with a portion
given to the Brahmans. The first bundle of corn
is deposited at the threshold of the home, and a libation
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>of water is made as a completion of its offering.
The grain being taken from the ear, of a portion of
this first-fruits, is mixed with milk and sugar, and
every member of the family tastes it seven times.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c012'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Prabhus of Bombay, at the time of the
birth of a child, an iron crowbar is placed “along
the threshold of the room of confinement, as a check
against the crossing of any evil spirit.” This is in
accordance with a Hindoo belief that evil spirits keep
aloof from iron, “and even nowadays pieces of horseshoe
can be seen nailed to the bottom sills of doors
of native houses.”<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c012'><sup>[40]</sup></a> Iron seems, in various lands, to
be deemed of peculiar value as a guard against evil
spirits, and the threshold to be the place for its efficacious
fixing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Similarly, “in East Bothnia, when the cows are
taken out of their winter quarters for the first time,
an iron bar is laid before the threshold, over which
all the cows must pass; for, if they do not, there
will be nothing but trouble with them all the following
summer.”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c012'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the folk customs in the line of exorcism
and divination in Italy, the threshold has prominence.
“In Tuscany, much taking of magical medicine is
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>done on the threshold; it also plays a part in other
sorcery.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> A writer mentions a method of exorcism
with incense, where three pinches of the best incense,
and three of the second quality, are put in a row on the
threshold of the door, and then, after other incense is
burned within the house in an earthen fire-dish, these
“little piles of incense on the threshold of the door”
are lighted, with words of invocation. This process is
repeated three times over.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A method of curing a disorder of the wrist prevalent
in harvest time, in North Germany, is by taking
“three pieces of three-jointed straw,” and so laying
them “side by side as to correspond joint by joint,”
then chopping through the first joint into the block beneath.
This “ceremony is performed on the threshold,
and ends with the sign of the cross.”<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Observances with reference to the threshold are
numerous in Russia. “On it a cross is drawn to keep
off <em>maras</em> (hags). Under it the peasants bury stillborn
children. In Lithuania, when a new house is being
built, a wooden cross, or some article which has been
handed down from past generations, is placed under
the threshold. There also when a newly baptized
child is being brought back from church, it is customary
for its father to hold it for a while over the threshold,
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>‘so as to place the new member of the family
under the protection of the domestic divinities’
[bringing it newly into the family covenant at the
threshold altar].... Sick children, who are supposed
to have been afflicted by an evil eye, are washed on
the threshold of their cottage, in order that, with the
help of the Penates who reside there, the malady
may be driven out of doors.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c012'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the annual feast known as “Death Week,”
among Slavonic peoples, marking the close of winter
and the beginning of spring, the peasants in rural
Russia combine for a sacrifice to appease the “Vodyaoui,”
or aroused water-spirit of the thawing streams.
They also prepare a sacrifice for the “Domovoi” or
house-spirit. A fat black pig is killed, and cut into
as many pieces as there are residents in the place.
“Each resident receives one piece, which he straightway
buries under the door-step at the entrance to his
house. In some parts, it is said, the country folk
bury a few eggs beneath the threshold of the dwelling
to propitiate the ‘Domovoi.’”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c012'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a Magyar maiden would win the love of a
young man, or would bring evil on him because of
his reluctance, she seeks influence over him by means
of the sacred threshold. “She must steal something
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>from the young man, and take it to a witch, who adds
to it three beans, three bulbs of garlic, a few pieces
of dry coal, and a dead frog. These are all put into
an earthenware pot, and placed under the threshold,”
with a prayer for the object of her desire.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A superstition is prevalent in Roumania, that if a
bat, together with a gold coin, be buried under the
threshold, there is “good luck” to the house.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> Various

<p class='c000'>In Japan, the threshold of the door is sprinkled
with salt, after a funeral, and as a propitiatory sacrifice
in time of danger.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Salt represents blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Dyaks of Borneo, a pig’s blood is
sprinkled at the doorway to atone for the sin of unchastity
by a daughter of the family. Again, the

<p class='c000'>“On New Year’s morning, along the coast [in

<p class='c000'>Of portions of Ireland, it was said, early in this century:
“On the 11th of November, every family of a village
kills an animal of some kind or other; those who
are rich kill a cow or sheep, others a goose or a turkey;
while those who are poor ... kill a hen or a cock, and
sprinkle the threshold with the blood, and do the
same in the four corners of the house; ... to exclude
every kind of evil spirit from the dwelling.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c012'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Holes bored in the door-sill, and plugged with
pieces of paper on which are written incantations, a
broom laid across the door-sill, or “three horseshoes
nailed on the door-step with toes up,” are supposed to
be a guard against witches or evil spirits in portions
of Pennsylvania to-day.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c012'><sup>[54]</sup></a> Many a Pennsylvanian is
unwilling to cross, for the first time, the threshold of

<p class='c000'>Among the Indians in ancient Mexico there was
an altar near the door of every house, with instruments
of sacrifice, and accompanying idols.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c012'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Threshold” and “foundation” are terms that are
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>used interchangeably in primitive life. The sacredness
of the threshold-stone of a building pivots on
its position as a foundation stone, a beginning stone,
a boundary stone. Hence the foundation stone of any
house, or other structure was sacred as the threshold
of that building. According to Dr. H.V. Hilprecht,
in the earlier buildings of Babylonia the inscriptions
and invocations and deposits were at the threshold,
and later under the four corners of the building; but
when they were at the threshold they were not under
the corners, and <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></em>. It would seem from
this that the corner-stone was recognized as the beginning,
or the limit, or the threshold, of the building.
It may be, therefore, that the modern ceremonies at
the laying of a “corner-stone” are a survival of the
primitive sacredness of a threshold-laying.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c012'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem, moreover, as if the sanctity of the
threshold as the primitive altar were, in many places,
in the course of time transferred to the family hearth.
In the primitive tent the household fire was at the
entrance way, as it is in the tents of the East to-day.
Where Arabs have camped on an Eastern desert, the
place of the shaykh’s tent can always be known by
the blackened hearthstones at its entrance, or threshold,
where he welcomed guests to the hospitality of
his tribe and family by the sharing of bread and salt,
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>or by the outpouring of the blood of a slaughtered
lamb or kid.</p>

<p class='c000'>If, indeed, the earliest dwelling of man was a cave,
rather than a tent, the household fire was still at its
entrance; and the threshold was the hearthstone.
When, in the progress of building-changes, the hearthstone
was removed to the center of the building, or
of the inner court, its sanctity went with it, as the
place of the family fire. Thus, for example, in Russia,
the Domovoi, or household deity, who is honored and
invoked at the threshold, “is supposed to live behind
the stove now, but in early times he, or the spirits of
the dead ancestors, of whom he is now the chief representative,
were held to be in even more direct relations
with the fire on the hearth; as were the Penates
of the Romans, who were sometimes spoken of as at
the threshold, and again as at the hearth.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c012'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A recognition of the peculiar sacredness of the
threshold is shown, in different lands, by the popular
unwillingness to have the dead carried over it on the
way to burial. In India, the body of one dying in
certain phases of the moon can in no wise be carried
over the threshold. The house wall must be broken
for its removal.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c012'><sup>[58]</sup></a> When Chinese students are attending
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>the competitive examinations for promotion, they
are shut up in rooms until their work is completed. If
one of them dies at such a time, “the body is removed
over the back wall, as the taking out openly through
the front door would be regarded as an evil omen.”<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c012'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the capital of Korea there is a small gate in the
city wall known as the “Gate of the Dead,” through
which alone a dead body can be carried out. But no
one can ever enter through that passage-way.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c012'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is a recognition, in Russian folk-tales, of safety
to the spirit of one who dies in a house, if his body be
passed out <em>under</em> the threshold of the outer door.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c012'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is not allowable to carry out a corpse through
the main door of a house in Italy. There is a smaller
door, in the side wall, known as the <em><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">porta di morti</span></em>,
which is kept closed except as it is opened for the
removal of a body at the time of a funeral.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c012'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Alaska, it is deemed an evil omen for the dead to
be carried over the threshold. “Therefore the dying
one, instead of being allowed to rest in peace in his
last hours, is hastily lifted from his couch and put out
of doors [or out of the house] by a hole in the rear
wall” so as not to have a corpse pass the threshold.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c012'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>In some communities, in both Europe and America,
the coffin is passed out of the house through the
window, instead of through the door, at a funeral.
And again, the front door is closed and a window is
opened at the time of a death, in order that the spirit
may pass out of the house in some other way than
over the threshold.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c012'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Even though the dead may not be lifted over the
threshold altar, the dead may be buried underneath it.
In both the far East and the far West, burials under
the threshold are known. And in Christian churches
of Europe, a grave underneath the altar is an honored
grave for saint or ecclesiastic.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Apocalypse the seer beheld “underneath the
altar the souls of them that had been slain for the
word of God, and for the testimony which they held:
and they cried with a great voice, saying, How long,
O Master, the holy and true, dost thou not judge and
avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c012'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. THRESHOLD COVENANTING IN THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Marriage customs in various parts of the world, in
ancient and modern times, illustrate this idea of the
sacredness of the threshold as the family altar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>In portions of Syria, when a bride is brought to her
husband’s home, a lamb or a kid is sacrificed on the
threshold, and she must step across the outpoured
blood.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c012'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This marks her adoption into that family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the wide-spreading ʾAnazeh Bed´ween, the
most prominent and extensive tribe of desert Arabs,
whose range is from the Sinaitic Peninsula to the
upper Desert of Syria, “when the marriage day is
fixed, the bridegroom comes with a lamb in his arms
to the tent of the father of his bride, and then, before
witnesses, he cuts its throat. As soon as the blood
falls upon the earth [and the earth is the only threshold
of a tent], the marriage ceremony is regarded as
complete.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c012'><sup>[67]</sup></a> “In Egypt, the Copts sacrifice a sheep as
the bride steps into the bridegroom’s house, and she
is compelled to step over the blood which flows upon
the threshold in the doorway.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> It is evident, moreover,
that this custom is not confined to the Copts.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Blood on the threshold, as an accompaniment of a
marriage, is still counted important among Armenian
Christians in Turkey. After the formal marriage ceremony
at the church, the wedded pair, with their friends,
proceed to the bridegroom’s home. “At the moment
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>of their arrival a sheep is sacrificed on the threshold,
over the blood of which the wedding party steps to
enter the house.”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the island of Cyprus, a bridegroom is borne to
the house of his bride on the wedding morning, in a
living chair formed by the crossed hands of his neighbor
friends. Dismounting at her door, “as he is about
to pass in, a fowl is brought and held down by head
and feet upon the threshold of the door; the bridegroom
takes an axe, cuts off the head, and only then
may he enter.”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Like customs are found among yet more primitive
peoples. Thus, for instance, with the western
Somali tribes, in east Central Africa: “On reaching
the bridegroom’s house a low-caste man sacrifices a
goat or sheep on the threshold; and the bride steps
over it;” and again when the bridegroom returns from
his devotions at a neighboring <em>masjid</em> (a place of
public prayer) to claim his bride, as he reaches his
threshold, “another goat is sacrificed, and he steps
over it in the same way as his bride.”<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c012'><sup>[72]</sup></a> Again the
bridegroom himself brings the bride from her father’s
hut to his own, accompanied by young men and
maidens dancing and singing. “On reaching the new
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>hut, the bride holds a goat or sheep in the doorway,
while the bridegroom cuts its throat in the orthodox
manner with his <em>jambia</em> (long knife). The bride dips
her finger in the blood, smears it on her forehead,
... and then enters the <em>gúrí</em>, stepping over the blood.
The bridegroom follows her, also stepping over the
blood, and is accompanied by some of his nearest
male relatives.”<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There are traces of such customs, also, among the
natives of South Africa,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the bloody sacrifices at the threshold, in
the marriage ceremony, there are, in different countries,
various forms of making offerings at the threshold,
and of surmounting obstacles at that point, as an
accompaniment of the wedding covenant. All these
point to the importance and sanctity of the threshold
and doorway in the primitive mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>A bride, in portions of Upper Syria, on reaching her
husband’s house, is lifted up so that she can press
against the door-lintel a piece of dough, prepared for
the purpose, and handed to her at the time. This
soft dough, thus pressed against the plastered or clay
wall, adheres firmly, and is left there as long as it
will remain. The open hand of the bride stamps the
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>dough as it is fixed in place, and in some cases the
finger points are pricked before the stamping, so that
the blood will appear as a sign manual on the cake
of dough.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a bride reaches the door of her husband’s
house, among the fellaheen of Palestine, a jar of water
is placed on her head. She must call on the name of
God as she crosses the threshold; and, at the same
moment, her husband strikes the jar from her head,
and causes the water to flow as a libation.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Wallachians there is a marriage rite,
said to be of Latin origin, because there was a similar
rite among the old Latins. The Wallachian bride is
borne on horseback, with an accompanying procession,
to the house of the bridegroom. “At the moment
when the betrothed maiden dismounts from her steed,
and is about to cross the threshold, they present to
her butter, or sometimes honey, and with this she
smears the door-posts.”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An observer says of this rite: “For the same reason
among the Latins, the word for wife, <em>uxor</em>, originally
<em>unxor</em>, was derived from the verb <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ungere</span></em>, ‘to anoint,’
because the maidens when they reached the threshold
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>of their future husbands, were similarly accustomed
to anoint the door-posts.” In support of this fanciful
etymology, old-time commentators on Terence and
Virgil are cited;<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a> which shows, at least, that this ceremony
at the threshold of the husband’s home has
long been recognized as of vital importance in the
marriage contract and relation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is customary, among the Greeks in Turkey, for
the mother of the bridegroom, as he leaves his home
to go for his bride on the morning of his wedding, to
lay across his pathway a girdle, over which he steps,
and to pour a libation of water before him.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the Morea, in the vicinity of Sparta, it is said
that, when the bride is brought to her new home,
the mother of the bridegroom “stands waiting at the
door, holding a glass of honey and water in her hand.
From this glass the bride must drink; ... while the
lintel of the door is smeared with the remainder; ...
in the meantime one of the company breaks a pomegranate
on the threshold.”<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c012'><sup>[80]</sup></a> In Rhodes, when the
newly married couple enter the doorway of their new
home, the husband “dips his finger in a cup of honey,
and traces a cross over the door.... A pomegranate
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>is placed on the threshold, which the young husband
crushes with his foot as he enters, followed by his
wife, over whom the wedding guests throw corn and
cotton seeds and orange flower water.”<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c012'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On Skarpanto (Carpathos), an island lying between
Rhodes and Crete, when the bridegroom reaches the
door of the bride’s house “he is greeted by the
mother of the bride, who touches the nape of his
neck with a censer containing incense.... She further
gives him a present called <em>embatikon</em>,–that is to say,
‘the gift of in-going,’–and then places on the threshold
a rug or blanket folded, with a stick resting on
one of the corners. The bridegroom advances his
right foot, breaks the stick and passes in.”<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Morlacchi, in Dalmatia, it is, or was, a
custom for a bride to kneel and kiss the threshold of
her husband’s home, before crossing it for the first
time. Her mother-in-law, or some other near relative
of her husband, at the same time presented her with a
sieve full of different kinds of grain, nuts, and small
fruits, which the bride scattered behind her back as
she passed in.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is a custom in portions of Russia, when the bride
is about to leave her father’s home to meet the bridegroom,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>for the friends of the bridegroom to appear at
the door, and request that the bride be brought to
them. “After their request has been many times
repeated, the ‘princess’ [as the bride is called] appears,
attended by her relatives and attendants, but
stops short at the door. Again the bridegroom’s
friends demand the bride, but are told first to ‘cleanse
the threshold; then will the young princess cross
the threshold.’” Thereupon gifts are made by the
bridegroom’s friend, and the bride crosses the threshold
to go to the bridegroom.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Mordvins (or, Mordevins), a Finnish
people on the Volga, there are various customs in
connection with marriage, tending to confirm the idea
that the threshold is the household altar. In a ceremony
of betrothal, with a conference over the terms
of dowry, a prayer is offered to the “goddess of the
homestead,” and the “goddess of the dwelling-house;”
“the girl’s father then cuts off the corner of a loaf of
bread with three slashes of a knife, salts it, and places
it under the threshold, where the Penates are believed
to frequent. This is called the ‘gods’ portion.’” Bread
and salt are factors in a sacred covenant, and their
proffer to the household gods, at the threshold altar,
would seem to be an invitation to those gods to be a
party to the new marriage covenant. Again, after the
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>terms of betrothal are agreed on, there is the feast of
“hand-striking,” or ratification of the betrothal. On
that occasion also the “gods’ portion” is offered; and
“a little brandy is spilt under the threshold. Bread
and salt are once more placed under the threshold by
the bride’s father, who carries it from the table to the
household altar “on the point of the knife–under no
circumstances in his hands.”<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c012'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A custom of strewing the threshold of the home
of a new-married couple prevailed in Holland until
recent times.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> This was obviously a form of offering
at the household altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the evening before the marriage ceremony, in
the rural districts and smaller towns of Northern
Germany, the boys and girls, and others in the neighborhood,
are accustomed to appear at the door of the
bride’s house, and smash on the threshold earthen pots
and jars, with loud cries of joy. “Sometimes, whole
car-loads of broken pottery have to be removed from
the door the next morning.” And when the young
couple return to their home, after the ceremony at
the church, poor boys and girls are accustomed to
stretch a colored cord across the door of the house, to
prevent a passage over the threshold, unless the bridegroom
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>throws a handful of small coins among those
who bar the way.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Traces of the sacredness of the threshold altar seem
to exist in the wedding ceremonies in villages on the
coast of Aberdeenshire, Scotland. “After the marriage
is solemnized, ... the bride’s guests are entertained
at her home, and the bridegroom’s at his....
When the bride returns to her father’s house, after the
marriage, broken bread of various sorts is thrown
over her before she enters. The same ceremony is
gone through with the bridegroom at his father’s
door.”<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a girl among the Sea Dyaks of Borneo is
married, the wedding takes place at her house. The
marriage rite includes the erecting an altar before the
door of the house, and placing on it an offering of prepared
areca-nut, covered with a red cloth, the color
of blood. The families of the bride and the groom
then partake of that offering in covenant conclave.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A lover, among the Woolwas, in Central America,
when wooing a bride, would bring a deer’s carcass,
and a bundle of firewood, and deposit it outside of her
house door. If she accepted these, and took them
over the threshold, it was a betrothal.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> The covenant
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>seemed to consist in the reaching across the
threshold and accepting a proffered offering in a spirit
of loving agreement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Towkas, in the same part of the world,
a bridegroom would go with his friends to the home
of his bride, carrying a bundle of gifts for her. Sitting
down outside of the door, he would call on her
family to open to him. There being no response,
music would then be tried by his friends. At this the
door would be opened just far enough for him to put
a gift inside over the threshold. One by one his gifts
would be passed in, in this way, while the door opened
wider and wider. When the last gift was over the
threshold, the lover would spring within, and, seizing
the bride, would carry her across the threshold, and
take her to a temporary hut erected within a charmed
circle near by, while his friends guarded him from
intrusion.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And thus, in various ways, among widely different
primitive peoples, the marriage customs go to show
that the home threshold cannot be passed except by
overcoming a barrier of some kind, and making an
offering, bloody or bloodless, at this primal family
altar. An essential part of the covenant of union is a
halting at, and then passing over, the threshold of the
new home, with an accompanying sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. STEPPING OR BEING LIFTED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Even more widespread and prominent than the
custom of offering blood, or of making a libation, or
of overcoming a special barrier, at the threshold, or
of anointing or stamping the posts or lintel of the
doorway as a sign of the covenant, at the time of a
marriage, and as a part of the ceremony, is the habit
of causing the bride to cross the threshold with care,
without stepping upon it. This custom is of well-nigh
world-wide observance, and it has attracted the
attention of anthropologists and students of primitive
customs. A favorite method of explaining it has
been by calling it a survival of the practice of “marriage
by capture;” but this is nothing more than an
unscientific guess, in defiance of the truth that persistent
popular customs have their origin in a sentiment,
and not in a passing historic practice. The
earliest mentions of this custom, of the bride’s crossing
the threshold without stepping on it, show it as a
voluntary religious rite; and there are traces of its
recognition in this light from the earliest times until
now.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Vedic Sutras, or the sacrificial rules of the
ancient Hindoo literature, it is specifically declared
that a bride, on entering her husband’s home, shall
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>step across the threshold, and not upon it. She is
not lifted over the door-sill, but she voluntarily crosses
it. Thus it is said: “When (the bridegroom with his
bride) has come to his house, he says to her, ‘Cross
(the threshold) with thy right foot first; do not stand
on the threshold.’”<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> In this ancient ceremony, grains
of rice are poured on the heads of the bridegroom
and his bride.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> This modern custom has, therefore, a
very early origin. And again: “He makes her enter
the house (which she does) with her right foot. And
she does not stand on the threshold.”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Putting the right foot forward seems to be a matter
of importance in various primitive religions. “Put
your right foot first” is a maxim ascribed to Pythagoras.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
In his description of the proportions of a temple,
the Roman architect Vitruvius said: “The number
of steps in front should always be odd, since, in that
case, the right foot, which begins the ascent, will be
that which first alights on the landing of the temple.”<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a>

foot first in crossing over the threshold of a mosk.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Albanians, when the bride is taken to
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>the home of the bridegroom, accompanied by the

“particular care is taken that the threshold should be
crossed with the right foot foremost.”<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> Here, as in
India, the crossing of the threshold is a voluntary act.
The bride is not lifted over, but crosses of her own
accord. If she be veiled, the lifting is a necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Madagascar, “on entering a house, especially a
royal house, it is improper to use the left foot on first
stepping into it. One must ‘put one’s best (or right)
foot foremost.’”<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The bride, in Upper Syria, is sometimes carried
across the threshold of the bridegroom’s house by
friends of the bridegroom.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> She, of course, is veiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the bride reaches the outer gate of her husband’s
residence, in Egypt, the bridegroom meets her,
enveloped as she is in her cashmere shawl, clasps her
in his arms, and carries her across the threshold, and
up to the doorway of the female apartments.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In portions of Abyssinia, the bridegroom carries his

threshold as he enters his house.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>So, also, it is among the more primitive tribes in
West Africa. The bride is carried over the threshold

<p class='c000'>There are traces of a similar custom in the marriage
ceremonies of ancient Assyria.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Again, it is said to be found among the Khonds of

of the bride over the threshold of her new home was
an important part of the marriage ceremony. Classic
writers had their explanations of this custom, as certain
modern anthropologists have theirs, but the origin
of the ceremony was earlier than they imagined.</p>

<p class='c000'>In unchanging China the use of fire on the threshold
altar, in connection with the marriage ceremony, is
continued to the present day. The bride is borne in
a sedan-chair to the house of the bridegroom, accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>by a procession of friends and musicians.
“On arriving at the portal of the house, the bridegroom
taps the door of the sedan-chair with his
fan, and in response, the instructress of matrimony,
who prompts every act of the bride, opens the door
and hands out the still enshrouded young lady, who
is carried bodily over a pan of lighted charcoal, or a
red-hot coulter laid on the threshold, while at the
same moment a servant offers for her acceptance some
rice and preserved prunes.”<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Again, it is burning straw that is thrown upon the
door-sill, and is half extinguished before the Chinese
bride is led to step across it. The instructress says at
this point:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now, fair young bride, the smoke bestride;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Fire, like blood, stands for life in the primitive
mind; and fire, like blood, has its place on the altar.
Indeed, as the first threshold altar was the hearthstone,
it was the place of the household fire. The
sacredness of the domestic fire is recognized in
all the Hindoo religious literature; and a Hindoo
couple, on beginning their married life, must have a
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>care to enter a new home bringing their sacred altar
fire with them.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a> In ancient Greece, the mother of
the bride accompanied her daughter to the threshold
of her new home, bearing a flaming torch “kindled
at the parental hearth, according to custom immemorial.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a>
A torch was similarly borne in the Roman
marriage ceremonies.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> This custom is referred to in
the term “hymen’s torch,” or the “nuptial torch.”
“In Cicero’s time, they did not distinguish the hearth-fire
from the Penates, nor the Penates from the Lares.”<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
The bride, in India, in China, in Greece, and in Rome,
worshiped at the altar-fire of her new home.</p>

<p class='c000'>A connecting link between the altar fire and the nuptial
torch is found in a marriage custom of the Erza,
of the Mordvins, in Russia. On the eve of the wedding
day the bridegroom’s family make ready for the
bride. “A thick candle, and several thinner ones,
have ... been made ready for the occasion. The
bridegroom’s father lights the smaller ones before the
holy pictures [in use in families of the Greek Church],
but sets up the large one on the threshold. It is
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>called ‘the house candle.’” The father then prays
for the new couple.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A survival of an ancient Slavic custom, of covenanting
together by crossing together an altar fire, would
also seem to exist in Russia in the practices of young
people at the “Midsummer Day” festival. A Russian
writer says of these festivals: “More than once
have I had an opportunity of being present at these
nightly meetings, held at the end of June, in commemoration
of a heathen divinity. They usually take
place close to a river or pond; large fires are lighted,
and over them young couples, bachelors and unmarried
girls, jump barefoot.”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is a custom of wooing among the Moksha,
of the Mordvins, that brings the threshold-altar idea
into prominence. The parents of the wooer first make
gifts, at their home, to the household goddesses.
“These gifts consist of dough figures of domestic
animals, which are placed under the threshold of the
house and of the outside gate, while prayer is made to
the goddesses and to deceased ancestors. The father
[of the bridegroom] then cuts off a corner of a loaf
placed on the table, and at the time of the offering
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>scoops out the inside and fills it with honey. At midnight
he drives in profound secrecy to the house of
the bride elect, places the honeyed bread on the gate-post
[of her house], strikes the window with his whip,
and shouts: ‘<em>Seta!</em> I, <em>Veshnak Mazakoff</em>, make a
match between thy daughter and my son <em>Uru</em>. Take
the honeyed bread from thy gate-post, and pray.’”<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a>
The images of domestic animals would here seem to
stand for the slaughtered animals formerly offered at
the threshold altar; and the linking of the altars of
the two homes by offerings and prayer would seem to
indicate the desire for a sacred covenant. When the
bride is received at the bridegroom’s house, a notch is
cut “with an ax in the door-post to mark the arrival
of a new addition to the family.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Erza, of the same province, the bride, on
the day of “the girl’s feast,” preceding her marriage,
“takes mould [earth] from under the threshold [of
her parental home] with her finger-tips, and thrusts it
into her bosom,” as she goes out to seek a farewell
blessing from her friends. In the bridegroom’s home,
meanwhile, a lighted candle is placed on the threshold
of the door; and, in some regions, when he and his
friends go to the bride’s house to bring her to his
home, he and they are met at the door by her parents
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>with the covenanting bread and salt, and the words,
“Be welcome, come within.” As the bride is borne
out of her old home to go to her new one, she and
her party “all halt and bow to the gate, for there, or
in the courtyard, is the abode of the god that protects
the dwelling-place. The following prayer is
made to him: ‘<em>Kardas Sarks</em>, the nourisher, god of
the house, do not abandon her that is about to depart;
always be near her just as thou art here.‘” When
she reaches her new home, she is carried (over the
threshold), in the arms of some of her party, into the
house of the bridegroom, carrying a lighted candle.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The custom survived in portions of Scotland, as
recently as the beginning of this century, of lifting a
bride over the threshold, or the first step of the door.
A cake of bread, prepared for the occasion, was, at
the same time, broken by the bridegroom’s mother
over the head of the bride. The bride was then led
directly to the hearth, and the poker and tongs, and
sometimes the broom, were put into her hands “as
symbols of her office and duty.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lifting the bride over the threshold has been practiced
in recent times, in England, Ireland, and the
United States.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>Both bride and bridegroom were carried, on the
shoulders of their elders, across the threshold of their
new home, and laid on their bridal bed, in the marriage
ceremonies of some of the tribes of Central
America. And again the bridegroom carried his
bride in this way.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a> In either case, it was the crossing
of the threshold without stepping on it that was
the thing aimed at.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>5.  LAYING FOUNDATIONS IN BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the building of a house, as a new home, the
prominence given to the laying of the threshold, or to
its dedicating by blood, is another indication, or outcome,
of its altar-like sacredness. In Upper Syria a
sacrifice is often made at the beginning of the building
of a new house, and again at the first crossing of
its threshold. “When a new house is built,” among
the Metâwileh, “the owner will not reside in it until,
with certain formalities, a black hen has been carried
several times round the house and slaughtered within
the door,” as if in covenant dedication of the house.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Copts in Egypt, when the threshold of
a new house is laid, the owner slaughters a sheep or
a goat on the threshold, and steps over the blood,
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>as if in covenant for himself and his household with
Him to whom all blood, as life, belongs. Then he
divides the sacrificed victim among his neighbors;
and they in turn come and step across the blood on
the threshold, invoking as they do so a blessing on
the new house and its owner, while coming into covenant
with him.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The foundation-stone of a new building is, in a
sense, the threshold of that structure. Hence to lay
the foundations in blood is to proffer blood at the
threshold. Traces of this custom are to be found in
the practices or the legends of peoples wellnigh all
the world over.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Apparently the earlier sacrifices were
of human beings.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a> Later they were of animals substituted
for persons. The idea seems to have been
that he who covenanted by blood with God, or with
the gods, when his house, or his city, was builded,
was guarded, together with his household, while he
and they were dwellers there; but, if he failed to
proffer a threshold sacrifice, his first-born, or the first
person who crossed the bloodless threshold, would be
claimed by the ignored or defied deity.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is, indeed, a suggestion of this idea in the
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>curse pronounced by Joshua, when he destroyed the
doomed city of Jericho, against him who should rebuild
its walls, he not being in covenant with and
obedient to the Lord. “Cursed be the man before
the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho:
with the loss of his firstborn shall he lay the foundation
thereof, and with the loss of his youngest son
shall he set up the gates of it.”<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> A later record tells
of the fulfilment of this curse. It says of the reign of
Ahab: “In his days did Hiel the Bethel-ite build
Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof with the loss
of Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof
with the loss of his youngest son Segub; according to
the word of the Lord, which he spake by the hand of
Joshua the son of Nun.”<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Human sacrifices, in order to furnish blood at the
foundations of a house, or of a public structure, have
been continued down to recent times, or to the present,
in some portions of the world; and there are indications
in popular tradition that they were frequent
in a not remote past.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that at the building of Scutari, in Asia
Minor, “the workmen were engaged on its fortifications
for three years, but the walls would not stand.
Then they protested that the only possible way to succeed
was to lay under or in them a living human
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>being. They accordingly laid hold of a young woman
who brought them dinner, and immured her.”<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>According to a story in China, when the bridge
leading to the site of St. John’s College, in Shanghai,
was in process of building, an official present took off
his shoes, as indicating his rank, and threw them into
the stream, in order to stay the current, and enable
the workmen to lay the foundations. Finding this
unavailing, he took off his garments and threw them
in. Finally he threw himself in, and as his life went
out the workmen were enabled to go on with their
building. To this day the belief is general that that
structure stands fast because of this sacrifice.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“When the walls of Algiers were built of blocks of
concrete [by Muhammadans], in the sixteenth century,
a Christian captive named Geronimo was placed in one
of the blocks and the rampart built over and about him.
Since the French occupation of Algiers a subsidence
in the wall led to an examination of the blocks, and one
was found to have given way. It was removed, and
the cast of Geronimo was discovered in the block.
The body had gone to dust, and the superincumbent
weight had crushed in the stone sarcophagus.”<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>A story told among the Danes is, that “many
years ago, when the ramparts were being raised round
Copenhagen, the wall always sank, so that it was
not possible to get it to stand firm. They therefore
took a little innocent girl, placed her in a chair
by a table, and gave her playthings and sweetmeats.
While she thus sat enjoying herself, twelve masons
built an arch over her, which, when completed, they
covered with earth to the sound of drums and trumpets.
By this process the walls were made solid.”<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Thuringian legend declares that to make the castle
of Liebenstein fast and impregnable, a child was
bought for hard money of its mother, and walled in.
It was eating a cake while the masons were at work,
the story goes, and it cried, ‘Mother, I see thee still;’
then later, ‘Mother, I see thee a little still;’ and as
they put in the last stone, ‘Mother, now I see thee no
more.’”<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c012'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A similar story is told of a Slavic town on the
Danube. A plague devastated it, and it was determined
to build it anew, with a new citadel. “Acting
on the advice of their wisest men, they sent out messengers
before sunrise one morning in all directions,
with orders to seize upon the first living creature they
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>should meet. The victim proved to be a child
(<em>Dyetina</em>, archaic form of <em>Ditya</em>), who was buried alive
under the foundation-stone of the new citadel. The
city was on that account called Dyetinets [or Detinetz],
a name since applied to any citadel.”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c012'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is even said that “when, a few years ago, the
Bridge Gate of the Bremen city walls was demolished,
the skeleton of a child was found imbedded in the
foundations.”<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c012'><sup>[134]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A Scottish legend tells that St. Columba found
himself unable to build a cathedral on the island of
Iona unless he would secure its stability and safety
by the blood of a human sacrifice. Thereupon he
took his companion, Oran, and buried him alive at
the foundations of the structure, having no trouble
after that.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c012'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And it is said that under the walls of the only two
round towers of the ancient Irish examined, human
skeletons were found buried.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c012'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Until the transfer of Alaska to the United States, in
1867, by the Russian government, human sacrifices at
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>the foundation of a new house were common in that
portion of America. The ceremonies are thus described
by one familiar with them: “The rectangular
space for the building is ... cleared, a spot for the
fireplace designated, and four holes dug, wherein the
corner posts are to be set.... A slave, either man or
woman who has been captured in war or is even a
descendant of such a slave, is blindfolded and compelled
to lie down face uppermost, in the place selected
for the fireplace [the site of the domestic altar]. A
sapling is then cut, laid across the throat of the slave,
and, at a given signal, the two nearest relatives of the
host sit upon the respective ends of the sapling, thereby
choking the unhappy wretch to death. But the
corner posts must receive their baptism; so four slaves
are blindfolded, and one is forced to stand in each
post-hole, when, at a given signal, a blow on the forehead
is dealt with a peculiar club ornamented with
the host’s coat of arms.” It is said that even to the
present time, on the building of a house in Alaska,
“the same ceremonies are enacted, with the exception
of the sacrifices, which are prevented by the United
States authorities.”<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Hindoostan, Burmah, Tennasserin, Borneo, Japan,
Galam, Yarriba, Polynesia, and elsewhere, there are
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>modern survivals of this foundation-laying in blood.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
It would seem, indeed, to have been wellnigh universal
as a primitive usage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Popular ballads give other indications of such customs,
in various lands. “In a song, of which there
are several versions, of the building of the bridge
of Arta, it is told how the bridge fell down as fast
as it was built, until at last the master-builder
dreamed a dream that it would only stand if his own
wife were buried alive in the foundations. He therefore
sends for her, bidding her dress in festival attire,
and then finds an excuse to make her descend into
the central pile, whereupon they heap the earth over
her, and thus the bridge stands fast.”<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“In another song the same story is told of the
Bridge of Tricha, with the difference only that it is a
little bird that whispers in the architect’s ear how the
pile may be made to stand. A similar superstition
connected with the building of the monastery Curtea
de Argest, in Wallachia, forms the subject of a fine
poem by the Roumanian poet Alexandri.”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is an indication of a like custom among the
Vlachs in Turkey, as shown in their folk-poetry.
The ballad of the “Monastery of Argis” tells of such
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>an incident, in which the master-builder Manoli plays
a part.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Various substitutes for human offerings at the laying
of a foundation-stone, or a threshold, have been
adopted in different countries. Thus, in modern
Greece, “after the ground has been cleared for the
foundations of a new house, the future owner, his
family, and the workmen attend, together with the
<em>pappas</em> [the priest] in full canonicals, accompanied
by incense, holy water, and all due accessories. A
prayer is said, and those present are aspersed, and
the site is sprinkled with the consecrated water.
Then a fowl or a lamb, which you have noticed lying
near with the feet tied together, is taken by one of the
workmen, killed and decapitated, the <em>pappas</em> standing
by all the while, and even giving directions; the
blood is then smeared on the foundation-stone, in the
fulfilment of the popular adage that ‘there must be
blood in the foundation.’”<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c012'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The modern Greek term for this ceremony, <em>stoicheionein</em>,
would seem to indicate a sacrifice to the deity
of the threshold, or the foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Bulgarians, it is said, when laying a house
foundation, take a thread, and measure the shadow of
some casual passer-by. The measure is then buried
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>under the foundation-stone, and it is expected that the
man whose shadow has been thus treated will soon
become but a shade himself.... Sometimes a victim
is put to death on the occasion; the foundations being
sprinkled with the blood of a fowl, or a lamb, or some
other species of scapegoat.”<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c012'><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Russian peasants the idea prevails that
the building of a new house “is apt to be followed by
the death of the head of the family for which the new
dwelling is constructed, or that the member of the
family who is the first to enter it will soon die. In
accordance with a custom of great antiquity, the oldest
member of a migrating household enters the new
house first; and in many places, as, for instance, in
the Government of Archangel, some animal is killed
and buried on the spot on which the first log or stone
is laid.”<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The “upper corner” of a house, in Russia, is peculiarly
sacred, having even more honor than the doorway
threshold in the ordinary home. Yet this upper
corner seems to be in a sense the real threshold, or
foundation corner, of the building. A cock is the
ordinary victim sacrificed “on the spot which a projected
house is to cover.” The head of this cock is
buried “exactly where the ‘upper corner’ of the
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>building is to stand.” And this corner is thenceforward
a sacred corner. Opposite to it is the stove.
It is called the “great” and the “beautiful” corner.
The family meal is eaten before it, and every one who
enters the cottage makes obeisance toward it. Formerly
ancestral images are supposed to have been in
that corner, and now holy pictures are there.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a> It
would seem to be in accordance with this idea that
the foundation-stone, or threshold, of a new building,
which in civilized lands is now laid with imposing
ceremonies, is known as the “corner-stone.” Yet the
“corner-stone” of a modern building is sometimes at
the corner of the central doorway.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is worthy of note that in ancient Egypt the one
door of an ordinary dwelling-house was placed at one
side, or end, of the front wall, and not in the center;
so that the corner-stone of the building was literally a
portion of the threshold.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> The same was true of many
an old-time New England house; the “front door”
was at the left-hand side (as one approached the house)
of the gable end. Thus the threshold of the door was
often the corner-stone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ancient Romans were accustomed to place statues
and images, instead of living persons, under the foundations
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>of their buildings, as has been shown by
recent researches in and about Rome.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a> In one instance,
where a fine statue of colossal size and in perfect
preservation was unearthed, at the foundations of
a convent which was being enlarged, “by order of the
monks, it was buried again,” as if in deference to the
primitive belief that it was essential to the stability
of the structure.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is a Swedish tradition “that under the altar
in the first Christian churches a lamb was usually
buried, which imparted security and duration to the
edifice.”<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c012'><sup>[150]</sup></a>  And, “according to Danish accounts,
a lamb was buried under every altar, and a living
horse was laid in every churchyard before a human
corpse was laid in it. Both lamb and horse are to
be seen occasionally in the church- or grave-yard, and
betoken death. Under other houses pigs and hens
were buried alive.”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c012'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A new sacrificial stone, or altar of sacrifice, laid on
the summit of a Mexican temple, in 1512, was consecrated
by Montezuma by the blood of more than
twelve thousand captives.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c012'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>When the new railroad was built between Jaffa and
Jerusalem, a few years ago, there were sacrifices of
sheep at its beginning. And there were similar sacrifices
at the foundations of the Turkish building, at the
Columbian Exposition at Chicago.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all these facts or legends, blood on the threshold
of the building, in the foundation-stones of the structure,
is shown to have been deemed an essential factor
in a covenant with, or in propitiation of, the deity of
the place.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>6. APPEALS AT THE ALTAR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Because the threshold is recognized as an altar,
nearness to the altar is nearness to God, or to the
gods worshiped at that altar. Hence appeals are made
and justice is sought at the gate, or at the threshold,
as in the presence of deity.</p>

<p class='c000'>To present one’s self at the tent doorway, or to lay
hold of the supports, or cords, at the entrance of an
Arab’s “house of hair,” is recognized as an ever-effective
appeal for hospitality in the East. Even an
enemy can thus secure the protection of the home
sanctuary.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c012'><sup>[153]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the excavation of Tell-el-Hesy, in Southwestern
Palestine, supposed to cover the remains of ancient
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>Lachish,<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a> Dr. Petrie discovered various ornamented
door-jambs. In one case a simple volute on a pilaster
slab suggested to Dr. Petrie “a ram’s horn nailed up
against a wooden post;” and “he sees in this the
origin of the type of the ‘horns of the altar,’<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a> so often
mentioned in temple architecture.”<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a> If Dr. Petrie be
correct in this thought, the horns of the altar were first
of all at the house doorway, above the threshold altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the fundamental laws of the Afghans makes
it incumbent on a host to “shelter and protect any
one who in extremity may flee to his threshold, and
seek an asylum under his roof.” Property or life
must be sacrificed in his behalf, if need be. “As soon
as you have crossed the threshold of an Afghan you
are sacred to him, though you were his deadly foe,
and he will give up his own life to save yours.” A
favorite poem of the Afghan, entitled, “Adam Khan
and Durkhani,” tells of a son who killed his father
because that father had betrayed a refugee who sought
the sanctuary of his threshold. And all Afghans
honor the memory of that son.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Arabs of the Syrian desert, when a
man would leave his own tribe and join himself to
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>another, he takes a lamb or a goat with him, and
presents himself at the entrance of the tent of the
shaykh of the tribe he would find a home in. Slaying
the animal there, and allowing its blood to run out on
the ground at the threshold of the tent, he makes his
appeal to the shaykh to accept him as a member of
his tribe, or as a son by adoption. And this appeal
has peculiar force, as a voice by blood.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a man among these tribes is in peril of his
life, pursued by an enemy, he can similarly make an
appeal for sanctuary at the threshold altar of a shaykh’s
tent, with a like outpouring of the blood of an animal
brought by him; and protection must be granted him
by the shaykh. It is as though he had laid hold of
the “horns of the altar.” So, again, when a man
would be reconciled with an enemy who has cause for
bitter hostility, he goes to the tent of that enemy
and sacrifices an animal at the threshold, with an
appeal for forgiveness. This offering of a threshold
sacrifice secures his safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>In other portions of Arabia this same idea finds a
different but similar expression. “With bare and
shaven head the offender appears at the door of the
injured person, holding a knife in each hand, and,
reciting a formula provided for the purpose, strikes
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>his head several times with the sharp blades. Then
drawing his hands over his bloody scalp, he wipes
them on the door-post. The other must then come
out and cover the suppliant’s head with a shawl
[covering the offense, in covering the offender], after
which he kills a sheep, and they sit down together at
a feast of reconciliation.”<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A record on a Babylonian clay tablet, of the twenty-eighth
year of Nebuchadrezzar, affirms that “on the
second day of the month of Ab” a certain “Imbiʿa
shall bring his witness to the gate of the house of the
chief Bel-iddin, and let him testify” as to a certain
matter.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a> The gate of the chief man, or local magistrate,
would here seem to have been the recognized
court of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the palace ruins at Persepolis and Susa, the great
doorways show, in their architecture, the influence of
Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt. And in the relief
sculpture of those doorways there is seen a representation
of “the king sitting on his throne rendering
justice at his palace gate.”<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At one of the gates of modern Cairo, the writer has
seen a venerable Arab sitting in judgment on a case
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>submitted to him by the contestants. And such a
scene may be often witnessed at the gates of an
Oriental city.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with this primitive idea, it became a
custom in India for one who would obtain justice from
another to seat himself at the door of a house, or a tent,
and refuse to move from that position until he starved
to death, unless his claim were heeded. If the suitor
died at the door, or the household altar, the sin of
his death rested upon the householder. The suitor’s
blood cried out against the evil-doer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even to the present time appeals at the household
altar are made in blood, in portions of India. A case
recently before the British court in Kathiawar involved
an illustration of such an appeal. One of the
Charaus, a caste of heralds, had become responsible
with his life, according to custom, for the repayment
of a loan made to a land owner. The land owner
delayed payment, and seemed disposed to avoid it.
“The herald and his brother, with their old mother
for a sacrifice, went to the door of the debtor’s house
and demanded payment, as their family honor was at
stake. When the land owner would not pay, the herald
struck off the head of his mother with his sword
before the door, the brother at the same time wounded
(intending to kill) the debtor, and the two brothers
sprinkled the mingled blood of the sacrifice on the
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>householder’s door-posts. The land owner, smitten
by public infamy and the guilt of the matricide, starved
himself to death.”<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> References to this responsibility
of the heralds are found in the Mahabharata.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Even where the primitive custom of sacrificing at
the doorway has died out, there sometimes seems to
be a survival of it in popular phraseology. Talcott
Williams, of Philadelphia, relates an incident of his
experiences in Morocco, which illustrates this. He
says: “As I was riding through the Soko at Tangier
on a morning in June, 1889, a servant stopped me,
and said: ‘Four men, from near Azila (a town on
the seacoast of Morocco, about thirty miles away),
are waiting for you at the gate of the house of Mr.
Perdicarus, and they have killed a sheep.’ ‘What
have they killed a sheep for?’ said I. ‘Oh!’ said
the servant, ‘I don’t mean that they have actually
killed a sheep, but they are sitting at the gate, asking
for your help, and expect you to aid them in their
trouble, because they have heard that you have influence
with the American consul, and are a man of
importance in your own country, and we call that
“killing a sheep.”’ I think he added ‘at the gate,’
but my memory is not perfectly clear at this point. I
rode on to the house of my friend, where I was stopping,
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>and found there the kinsman of a sheikh, who
had been imprisoned by the American consul. They
seized my horse’s bridle, and, with the usual Oriental
signs of respect, refused to let me dismount until I
had heard them and their plea for help.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was told by my own servant and the other Orientals
there, that this plea ‘at the gate,’ accompanied
as it was by the readiness to ‘kill a sheep,’ was one
which no man in Morocco would dream of disregarding.
I made some inquiry on the subject afterwards,
and found that the habit of sitting at the gate waiting
for a man of supposed influence or authority, while
absent, to return to his house, often actually accompanied,
though less frequently at present, by the
slaughter of a sheep, whose blood is poured across
the road over which he must pass, was a form used
only in cases of dire necessity, and one to which a
man with whom other pleas would avail nothing, felt
compelled to give attention. I am glad to add that
in my own case this ancient rite was not without its
fruits to those who had used it.”<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>See the Bible references to this idea. Moses stood
“in the gate of the camp,” at a crisis hour in Israel’s
history, when he would execute judgment in the
Lord’s cause.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a> All Israel was aroused to do judgment
against the sinning Benjamites because of the
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>appeal of the dying woman who fell at the door of the
house, “with her hands upon the threshold.”<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a> Boaz

<p class='c000'>The Lord’s call to Israel, through the prophets, was:
“Establish judgment in the gate,”<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a> and “Execute the
judgment of truth and peace in your gates.”<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a> A reference

thrust the awl “through his ear, unto [or into] the
door.”<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a> Here, apparently, the master and servant

<h3 class='c010'>7. COVENANT TOKENS ON THE DOORWAY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Because the threshold of the doorway is the primitive
altar of the household, the doorway itself is, as it
were, a framework above the altar; and the side-posts
and lintel of the doorway fittingly bear tokens or inscriptions
in testimony to the sacredness of the passage
into the home sanctuary. It would seem that
originally the blood poured out in sacrifice on the
threshold was made use of for marking the door-posts
and lintel with proofs of the covenant entered into between
the in-comer and the host; and that afterwards
other symbols of life, and appropriate inscriptions,
were substituted for the blood itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are survivals in the East, at the present time,
of the original method of blood-marking the frame of
the doorway; and there are traces of its practice in
ancient times in both the East and the West. President
Washburn, of Robert College, Constantinople,
says:<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> “I remember, after the great fire in Stamboul,
in 1865, going over the ruins, and coming to a house
that the fire had spared; a sheep had been sacrificed
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>on the threshold, and a hand dipped in the blood and
struck upon the two door-posts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This appears, also, in the installing of a Chief
Rabbi in modern Jerusalem. In the welcome to
the Hakham Bâshi, or the “First in Zion,”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> “the
multitude of those gathered together accompany him
to his house, but before he sets the sole of his foot
upon the threshold of the outer gate [or court] one
of the shokheteem [or official slaughterers] slays a
perfect beast, and pronounces the sacrificial blessing,
and all those present answer, Amen. Then the rabbi,
the Hakham Bâshi, steps over the beast which has
been slain, and the shokhet dips the two palms of his
hands into the blood, and marks first the vessels of the
rabbi’s house. And, with his hands stained with
blood, he forms the semblance of a hand above the
lintel of the door;–in their trust that this thing is
good [the proper thing] for the evil eye;–and the
flesh of the beast they distribute to the poor.”<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A custom in this same line is noted among the Jews
in Morocco, in connection with wedding observances.
“Whilst the bullock, or other animal, is being slaughtered
for the evening’s festivities, a number of boys
dip their hands in the blood, and make an impression
of an outspread hand on the door-posts and walls of
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>the bride’s house;” supposedly “for the purpose of
keeping off the ‘evil eye,’ and thus ensuring good luck
to the newly married couple.”<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There are indications of such a custom in ancient
times. Layard says of his researches in Assyria:
“On all the slabs forming entrances in the oldest
palaces of Nimroud, were marks of a black fluid
resembling blood, which appeared to be daubed on
the stone. I have not been able to ascertain the
nature of this fluid; but its appearance cannot fail to
call to mind the Jewish ceremony of placing the
blood of the sacrifice on the lintel of the doorway.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In ancient Egypt there were inscriptions, together
with the name of the owner, on the side-posts and
lintels of the dwellings. “Besides the owner’s name,”
says Wilkinson,<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a> “they sometimes wrote a lucky sentence
over the entrance of the house, for a favorable
omen, as ‘The Good Abode,’ the <em>múnzel mobárak</em> of
the modern Arabs, or something similar; and the
lintels and imposts of the doors in the royal mansions
were frequently covered with hieroglyphics, containing
the ovals and titles of the monarch. It was, perhaps,
at the dedication of the house, that these sentences
were affixed; and we may infer, from the early mention
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>of this custom among the Jews, that it was derived
from Egypt.”<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When it is understood that the inscribing, on the
doorways, of dedications to protecting deities, was
common among primitive peoples, it would seem to
be in accordance with that custom that the Hebrews
were commanded to dedicate their doorways to the
one living God. It is said of the words of the covenant
of God with his people, as recorded in Deuteronomy
6 : 4–9 and 11 : 13–21, “Thou shalt write them
upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy
gates.” To this day, among stricter Jews, these
covenant words inscribed on parchment, and enclosed
in a cylinder of glass, or a case of metal or of wood,
are affixed to the side-posts of every principal door in
the house. This case and inscription are called the
“mezuza.” On the outside of the written scroll, the
divine name, <em>Shaddai</em>,–“the Almighty,”–is so inscribed
that it may be in sight through an opening in
the case or cylinder. This name stands for “the
Guardian of the dwellings of Israel,” whose protection
is thus invoked above the primitive altar of the household
on the threshold of the entrance way.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Every pious Jew, as often as he passes the mezuza,
touches the divine name with the finger of his right
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>hand, puts it to his mouth and kisses it, saying in
Hebrew, ‘The Lord shall preserve thy going out and
thy coming in, from this time forth, and for evermore;’<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
and when leaving on a business expedition he says,
after touching it, ‘In thy name, <em>kuzu bemuchsaz kuzu</em>
(=God), I go out and shall prosper.’”<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> In some
cases the covenant words are inscribed directly upon
the door-posts, instead of being written on parchment
and enclosed in a case.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the lintels of the ancient synagogues in Palestine
there were sculptured symbolic figures, such as
the paschal lamb, a pot of manna, a vine, or a bunch
of grapes, together with inscriptions; and the door-posts
were ornamented more or less richly.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a> Evidences
of this are still abundant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the writing over the door and all
round the room at the office of the consul in Sidon,
Dr. Thomson says that Muhammadans “never set up
a gate, cover a fountain, build a bridge, or erect a
house, without writing on it choice sentences from
the Koran, or from their best poets. Christians also
do the same.”<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a> These writings are deemed a protection
against harm from evil spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>In Persia, both the Muhammadans and the Armenians
inscribe passages from their sacred books above
their doorways, with ornamental adornings, in “strange,
fantastic patterns.”<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a> The palace doorways in ancient

on the side-posts and lintel.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a> At the festival of
the fifth month of the Chinese year, “charms, consisting
of yellow paper of various sizes, on which are
printed images of idols, or of animals, or Chinese
characters, are pasted upon the doors and door-posts
of houses, in order to expel evil spirits.” In times of

<p class='c000'>Describing a ceremony on a large Chinese junk
when starting out on a long voyage, an observer tells
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>of the sacrifice of a fowl in honor of the divinity called
Loong-moo, or the Dragon’s Mother. A temporary
altar was erected at the bow of the vessel, as its beginning,
or threshold, and the blood of the sacrificed
fowl was shed there. Pieces of silver paper were
“sprinkled with the blood [of the fowl], and then
fastened to the door-posts and lintels of the cabin.”<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a>
The cabin door is the home door of the voyager.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the house door of almost every home, in large
portions of Japan, there is suspended the shimenawa,
or a thin rope of rice straw, which is one of the sacred
symbols of ancient Shintoism. Above the doors of
high Shinto officials, this symbol is of great size and
prominence. Its presence is as a sign of a covenant
with the gods.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The Greeks certainly recognized the entrance of the
house as the place for an altar to the protecting deity.
“Before each house stood, usually, its own peculiar
altar of Apollo Agyieus, or an obelisk rudely representing
the god himself;” and that over the house
door, “for good luck,” or as a talisman, “an inscription
was often placed.”<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> And on occasions, as when
a bride entered her husband’s house, the doorway was
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>“ornamented with festive garlands.”<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c012'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Theocritus refers
to a Greek custom of smearing the side-posts of the
gateway with the juice of magic herbs, as a method of
appeal to the guardian deity to influence the heart of
the dweller within toward the suppliant at the door.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Roman householders affixed to the lintels and side-posts
of their doors the spoils and trophies taken by
them in battle. Branches, and wreaths of bay and
laurel, were hung by them in the doorway on a marriage
occasion; and lamps and torches were displayed
at their doors at other times of rejoicing; while
cypresses were shown there at the time of a death.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Texts of Scripture, and other inscriptions, as a
means of invoking a blessing at the doorway, are frequently
found at the present time above the entrance
of houses in South Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Central America and in South America the blood
of sacrificial offerings was smeared on the doorways of
houses as well as of temples, as a means of covenanting
with the local deities. Illustrations of this are found
in the records and remains of Peru<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c012'><sup>[206]</sup></a> and Guatemala.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c012'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In both Europe and America, the practice of nailing
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>horseshoes on the side-posts of a doorway, for
“good luck,” or as a means of guarding the inmates
of the house from evil, is very common. So lately
as the seventeenth century it was said: “Most houses
of the West End of London have the horseshoe on
the threshold.”<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c012'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Even at the threshold of Christian
churches, in recent years, the symbol of the horseshoe
was to be found as a means of protection.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c012'><sup>[209]</sup></a> The
horseshoe is often to be found on a ship’s mast. At
the present time, horseshoes of various sizes, for use
as doorway guards against evil, are found on sale in
Philadelphia, and other centers of civilization.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>8.  SYMBOL OF THE RED HAND.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It would seem that, in primitive practice, the hand
of the covenanter dipped in the sacrificial blood on
the threshold, and stamped on the door-posts and
lintel, was the sign-manual of the covenant between
the contracting party or parties, and God, or the gods,
invoked in the sacrifice. Illustrations of this custom,
as still surviving in the East, have been given, from
Constantinople, Jerusalem, and Morocco.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c012'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Naturally,
therefore, the sign-manual by itself came to stand for,
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>or to symbolize, the covenant of the threshold altar;
and the stamp of the red hand became a token of trust
in God or the gods covenanted with in sacrifice, and
of power or might resulting from this covenant relation.
Wherever the red hand was shown, or found,
it was a symbol of covenant favor with Deity, and it
came to be known, accordingly, as the “hand of
might.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the region of ancient Babylonia, also, the red-hand
stamp is still to be seen on houses and on animals,
apparently as the symbol of their covenant consecration
by their owner. Dr. Hilprecht says: “Over all
the doors of the rooms in the large khan of Hillah,
on the Euphrates, partly built upon the ruins of ancient
Babylon, I noticed the red impression of an outspread
hand, when I was there in January, 1889. Several
white horses in our caravan from Bagdâd to Nippur
had the stamp of a red hand on their haunches.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This symbol is much used in Jerusalem. Referring
to its frequency, Major Conder says: “The ‘hand of
might’ is another Jewish belief which may be supposed
to have an Aryan origin. This hand is drawn
on the lintel or above the arch of the door. Sometimes
it is carved in relief, and before one house in
the Jews’ quarter, in Jerusalem, there is an elaborate
specimen, carefully sculptured and colored with
vermilion. Small glass charms, in the form of the
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>hand, are also worn, and the symbol is supposed to
bring good luck. The Jewish and Arab masons paint
the same mark on houses in course of construction;
and, next to the seven-branched candlestick, it is
probably the commonest house-mark in Jerusalem.”<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A Jerusalem Jew thus tells of its use among a portion
of his co-religionists in that city: “Our brethren
the Sephardeem [the Spanish Jews], like all the remnant
of the sons of the East, consider the semblance
of a hand as good against the power of the evil eye in
a man. And they draw this shape upon the doors of
their houses with a red finger. So, too, they place upon
the heads of their children a hand wrought in silver,
saying that this hand–or this picture of the five fingers–is
noxious to the man who delights to bring the evil
upon the child, or upon those dwelling in the house.
So, again, when men quarrel, the one sets his five fingers
before the other’s evil eye, saying that this sign
neutralizes the evil.”<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c012'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This sign of the hand is “found on the houses of
Jews, Muslims, and Christians, in various parts of
Palestine.” It is generally painted on or above the
door, often in blue; but frequently, especially when a
Jew or a Muhammadan enters a new house, a lamb is
sacrificed at the door, and the stamp of the hand in
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>the fresh blood is affixed to the post or to the walls.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
No one claims to know the origin of this symbol, but
all recognize its importance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In its ruder form the figure of the hand is much
like a five-branched candlestick. Indeed, it has sometimes
been mistaken for that symbol. This was the
case when such a figure was noticed, not long ago,
by Dr. Noetling, on Jewish houses in Safed, and reported
to a European journal. This symbol is sometimes
called the “Hand of Moses.” A similar figure
on Muslim houses is said to represent the “Hand of
the Prophet;” while in Syria, among Christians, it is
called the <em>Kef Miryam</em>, the “Virgin Mary’s Hand.”<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
Obviously these terms suggest the idea of power
through divinely derived strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the sights in the Mosk of St. Sophia, in
Constantinople, is the stamp of a red hand. It is said
that when Sultan Muhammad II. entered this sanctuary
as a conqueror, he dipped his right hand in the
blood of the slaughtered Christians, and stamped it on
the wall, as if to seal his victory, and to pledge his
covenant devotion to his God.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a> Whether this story
be fact or legend, it is a witness to the idea of such
a custom in the minds of Oriental peoples.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>An open hand is, or was, a common symbol on a
banner, as also on a prayer-rug, in both Turkey<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c012'><sup>[216]</sup></a> and
Persia. At the annual festival in Persia in commemoration
of the death of Hossein, son of Alee, two large
banners, each surmounted with an open hand, are
borne in front of the representation of the tomb of
Hossein; and the same symbol appears in various
ways during the celebration.<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“In the East Indies, to this day, the figure of a
hand is the emblem of power and governmental sway.
When the Nabob of Arcot was the viceroy of five
provinces, if he appeared in public there were carried
before him certain little banners, each with a hand
painted on it, and a larger banner with five hands.”<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c012'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Siva, the destroyer, in the Hindoo triad, is also
the re-creator; since death is only the entrance into
a new life. One of Siva’s well-known symbols is a
hand, which is a token of might and life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The uplifted open hand was prominent on or above
the doors in ancient Carthage.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c012'><sup>[219]</sup></a> And a traveler in
Northern Africa, writing of the Jews in Tunis, near
the site of Carthage, says: “What struck me most
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>in all the houses was the impression of an open
bleeding hand on every wall of each floor. However
white the walls, this repulsive sign was to be seen
everywhere. A Jewess never goes out here without
taking with her a hand carved in coral or ivory–she
thinks it a talisman against the ‘evil eye,’ or ‘<em>mal
occhio</em>.’... When his children’s pictures or horses
are praised, the Tunisian Jew extends his five fingers,
or pronounces the number ‘five;’ he tries by this
means to prevent the praise doing damage.”<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c012'><sup>[220]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This symbol of the open hand is frequently found
above the graves in the vicinity of Tunis. It is also
seen in old Jewish cemeteries in Europe, as, for instance,
in Prague.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c012'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An open hand, in stone, or metal, or enamel, or
bone, used as a talisman or an amulet, to guard the
wearer against evil, was in common use in ancient
Egypt. Specimens of these can be seen in museums
in Europe and America to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a noteworthy fact that the uplifted hand is
prominent in the representation of the deities of
Babylonia, Assyria, Phenicia, and Egypt, especially
of the gods of life, or of fertility, who have covenant
relations with men. And the same is true of the
representations of sovereigns, in the ancient East, who
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>are supposed to be in peculiar covenant relations with
the gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, on the seal of Ur-Gur, the earliest ruler of
“Ur of the Chaldees,”<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c012'><sup>[222]</sup></a> the ruler and his attendants
appear with uplifted hands before the moon-god Sin,
who in turn is represented with his hand uplifted, as
if he were making covenant with them.<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c012'><sup>[223]</sup></a> It is the
same with the sun-god Shamash and his worshipers.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c012'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a king of ancient Babylon was recognized as
having a right to the throne, he must lift up his hand
and clasp the hand of the image of Bel-Merodach, in
order to show that he had “become the adopted son
of the true ruler of the city.” This giving and taking
of the hand was a symbol of covenanting in Babylonia.
In this way a child was adopted into a family, and a
husband and a wife covenanted to become one.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The god Asshur, and his worshipers, kings or
princes, are similarly represented in Assyria with the
hand uplifted. And it is the same there with other
deities and their worshipers.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a> In Phenicia, and its
colonies, the same idea has prominence.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>Deities of ancient Egypt are frequently represented
with the uplifted hand, and their accepted worshipers
appear before them with the right hand uplifted.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c012'><sup>[228]</sup></a> As
showing that this is not the attitude of supplication
or of adoration, like the bowed form, the crossed arms,
or the upturned palms, it is to be noted that in the
representation of Amenophis IV., or Khuen-aten, with
his family, before the aten-ra or the solar disk, the
worshipers stand with their right hands uplifted, while
the sun-god reaches down a series of open hands, as
if in covenant proffer to the uplifted hands below.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the county of Roscommon, in Ireland, there is
a stone known as “a druidical altar,” which the common
people say was thrown there by the giant Fin-mac-Coole,
“the print of whose five fingers, they say,
is to be seen on it.” The hand-print is pointed to
confidently as the proof of authenticity, as if it were
the veritable signature of the giant.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c012'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the ruins in Central America, there were
found at the doorways and on the walls of many
of the ruined buildings of Yucatan the stamp of
a red hand on the plaster or on the stone. “They
were the prints of a red hand, with the thumb
and fingers extended, not drawn or painted, but
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>stamped by the living hand, the pressure of the
palm upon the stone. He who made it had stood
before it alive, ... and pressed his hand, moistened
with red paint, hard against the stone. The seams
and creases of the palm were clear and distinct in
the impression.” As showing the idea prevalent
among the natives of that region with reference to the
source and meaning of these signs-manual, the Indians
of Yucatan said that the stamp was of “the hand
of the owner of the building,” as if he had affixed it to
his dwelling in token of his covenant with its guardian
deity; and, again, it was thought that “these impressions
were placed there in a formal act of consecration
to the gods.”<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is a clear recognition of this idea in many
Bible references to the lifting up of the hands unto
God, as if in covenant relations with him. Thus,
Abraham says to the king of Sodom, “I have lift up
my hand unto the Lord;”<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c012'><sup>[232]</sup></a> as if he would say, I have
pledged myself to him. I have given him my hand.
And the Psalmist says: “I will lift up my hands in
thy name.”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a> God himself says, by his prophet: “I
will lift up mine hand to the nations;”<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a> that is, I will
covenant with them.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a> And so in many another case.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>Indeed, the Assyrian word for swearing (<em>nish</em>) is
literally “lifting up the hand;”<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a> and the Hebrew
word <em>nasa</em> means to lift up the hand or to swear.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a>
The uplifted hand in a judicial oath seems to be a
survival of the same thought, that an appeal is thus
made to God, as one’s covenant God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again, there may be a reference to the “hand of
might” in a covenant relation, in those passages
where God is spoken of as bringing his people out of
Egypt by “a strong hand,” or “a mighty hand,” and
as dealing with them afterwards in the same way.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An uplifted hand is a symbol found also on the
stepped pyramid temples of Polynesia.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This sign of the red hand is still a familiar one
among the aborigines of America. It is stamped on
robes and skins, and on Indian tents.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a> Schoolcraft
says of it: “The figure of the human hand is used
by the North American Indians to denote supplication
to the Deity or Great Spirit, and it stands in the
system of picture-writing as the symbol for strength,
power, or mastery, thus derived [through a covenant
relation]. In a great number of instances which I
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>have met with of its being employed, both in the ceremonial
of their dances and in their pictorial records,
I do not recollect a single one in which this sacred
character is not assigned to it.”<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c012'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A frequent use of the hand-print among the American
Indians is as “a symbol applied to the naked
body after its preparation and decoration for sacred
and festive dances.” These preparations are “generally
made in the arcanum of the medicine, or secret
lodge, or some private place, and with all the skill of
the priest’s, the medicine-man’s, or the juggler’s art.
The mode of applying it in these cases is by smearing
the hand of the operator with white or colored clay,
and impressing it on the breast, the shoulder, or other
part of the body. The idea is thus conveyed that a
secret influence, a charm, a mystic power, is given to
the dancer, arising from his sanctity, or his proficiency
in the occult arts.” Schoolcraft, speaking of this custom,
says: “The use of the hand is not confined to a
single tribe or people. I have noticed it alike among
the Dacotah, the Winnebagoes, and other Western
tribes, as among the numerous branches of the red
race still located east of the Mississippi River, above
the latitude of 42°, who speak dialects of the Algonquin
language.”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>Is there possibly any connection with this idea in
the custom of “the laying on of hands,” as a symbol
of imparting virtue or power to one newly in covenant
relations with those who are God’s representatives,
so frequently referred to in the Bible?<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a> This
would seem to be indicated by the power imparted to
an Egyptian king by the touch of the uplifted hand
of the deity, as shown in the representations on the
monuments of Egypt. It was known as “the imposition
of the Sa,” or increased vitality.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A remarkable illustration of the use of the red-hand
print among American Indians is given in the story
of a famous Omaha chief, who, when dying, enjoined
it upon his followers to carry his body to a prominent
look-out bluff above the Missouri River, and bury him
there, full armed, on the back of his favorite war-horse,
who was to be buried alive, that he might watch from
that place the passing of the whites up and down the
river. It would seem as if he wanted to be known as
dying in the faith of his covenant relations with the
Great Spirit, for himself and for his people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Because of this request, in the presence of his assembled
tribe “he was placed astride his horse’s back,
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>with his bow in his hand, and his shield and quiver
slung; with his pipe and his medicine bag; with his
supply of dried meat, and his tobacco pouch replenished;
... with his flint and steel, and his tinder, to
light his pipe by the way. The scalps that he had
taken ... were hung to the bridle of his horse. He
was in full dress and equipped; and on his head
waved ... his beautiful head-dress of the war-eagle’s
plumes.” As he stood thus on the threshold of the
life beyond, when the last funeral honors were performed
by the medicine-men, “every warrior of his
band painted the palm and fingers of his right hand
with vermilion, which was stamped and perfectly impressed
on the milk-white sides of his devoted horse,”–as
if in covenant pledge of fidelity to their chief in
the sight of the Great Spirit.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There is another phase of the red-hand symbolism
among the American Indians, which has been noted
by Frank H. Cushing, who is so experienced and
careful an observer of their customs and ceremonies.
This phase connects the symbol directly with the idea
of life and its transmission. Mr. Cushing says:<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“By reference to the paintings (and writings, to
some extent) of such men as Catlin and Stanley, and
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>to the works of Schoolcraft, Matthews, Bourke, and
others, you will find that the red-hand symbol was
painted on the lodges, sometimes on the clothing and
person, and sometimes on the shields of various of the
hunter tribes of the plains,–as, for example, of the
Ioways, Sauks and Foxes, Sioux, Arickarees, Cheyennes,
Arapahos, and Comanches. Precisely what
the significance of the symbol was, with these peoples
and others like them, I am not able to say, save that
in some cases it was connected with war, in others
with treaties, and in yet others as expressive of power.
There were yet other meanings attached to the sign;
but neither the former significances nor these latter
were, I take it, as definite or fixed [with the hunter
tribes] as with the more advanced and settled tribes
of the farther south.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of these tribes, the typical Pueblos and the peoples
more or less directly influenced by them–such as the
Jicarillas on the north and east, and the Apaches to
the south and west<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a>–made frequent use of not only
the red-hand symbol, but also of the black-hand symbol.
I have seen both, not only in the modern but
also in the very ancient pueblos–as those of the
Pecos, and those of the great cliff-dweller towns in
the Chelly and other canyons. In the Pecos ruins, to
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>give a special example, I copied beautiful hand-paintings
and prints from the rafters, as well as from the
walls of ordinary dwelling-rooms. Sometimes these
paintings were in red, but more often in black. They
invariably represented the hands of women, as could
be seen by their delicacy and smallness of outline and
by their shapeliness. There was, I think, a reason for
this, which the following facts will explain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was my good fortune to witness, early in the
eighties, a ceremonial celebrating the attainment to
puberty, or womanhood, of a young girl of the Jicarilla
Apaches. The latter people are not to be confounded
with the Apaches proper. They are a mixed people,
descended not only from the Apaches, but also the
Comanches, and in large part also from the Pueblos
of the north, the so-called Tañoans of whom the Pecos
people were a branch. It was clear from the character
of the masks and other paraphernalia used in the
ceremonials I witnessed, that the latter were almost,
if not quite, wholly derived from the pueblo, rather
than from the wilder, ancestry of the Jicarillas who
performed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ceremonial in question was performed by four
medicine-men, or priests, as one might call them,
within and around a rectangular enclosure of evergreen
boughs set in the plain near to the village. Inside of
this enclosure, which was designed to screen from
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>view the more secret operations of the priest dancers
in question, stood a little conical skin lodge, the snow-white
top of which appeared above the screen of evergreen,
and within which the young girl, over whom
these rites were being enacted, was ensconced, together
with one or two old women of the tribe. As I
have said before, each of the priests, on appearing
(and this they did successively; that is, the first on
the first day, the second on the second day, and so
on), wore a conical mask or helmet, which entirely
concealed, not only the face, but also the head. This
mask was painted black or red, and upon the face of
it appeared one of these hand symbols. Unfortunately,
I did not see the mask as worn by the first
priest, but, as worn by the second priest on the morning
of the second day, it bore upon its face the symbol
of the red hand; and as worn upon the third day,
this symbol recurred, but, if I remember aright, was
surrounded by an outline of another color, either black
or yellow, whilst the hand painted on the mask as
worn on the fourth day was black surrounded by
white, that it might stand out more conspicuously;
and in turn, below it, were two or more dots alternating
with dotted circles.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My means of communicating with these people
were but limited, but on learning that the ceremonials
they were performing were designed to celebrate the
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>attainment to maturity, or womanhood, of a virgin, I
had little difficulty in understanding the significance
of the succession of these various hand symbols. I
recognized in the ceremonial as a whole the dramatic
epitomization, to state it briefly, of the four ages of a
woman’s life. Thus the white hand (which I was told
had been painted on the mask of the first day) symbolized
her infancy and girlhood, the consummation
of which was effected by the first day’s ceremonial performed
by the medicine-man of the white hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The red hand was obviously significant of this girl’s
attainment to young womanhood, the color in this
case symbolizing the blood of her perfected life. I
imagine that the black hand painted on the mask
as worn during the third day’s ceremonial was significant
of not only the betrothal of the girl, which
was said to have taken place during that day of the
ceremonial, but also of her prospective maternity; the
change of color, in the hand, from red to black, being
naturally a symbolic representation of the change
from red to black in blood that has been exposed to
the sunlight and dried, and has thus become black,
and is no longer virgin. Likewise the hand painted
on the mask as worn during the fourth day’s ceremonial,
which was wholly black, doubtless represented
the fuller life of not only a matron but a grandmother.
From this I would infer that the signs of the red and
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>black hands found in the ruined pueblos like those of
Pecos, and on the cliffs at the mouths of caves, or in
the houses of the cliff villages, symbolized respectively
virginity, and maternity or betrothal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What would seem to indicate the correctness of
this conclusion is the fact that, as I have mentioned
before, there were below the signs of the black hand
of the last day’s ceremonial of the Jicarillas dots and
dotted circles. It is well known that these dots and
dotted circles represent, primarily, grains of corn, male
and female; and, secondarily, children, male and
female. Their occurrence, then, below the painted
black hand or symbol of maternity, would indicate
that in this case they represented the children and
perhaps grandchildren, male and female, of the matron
it was hoped this young girl might become.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The hand symbol as occurring amongst the Zuñi,
with whom, of course, I am much more familiar, has
not only some such significances as these, but also
many others,–the significance of a given symbol depending
upon the ceremonial with which it is associated,
and particularly upon the coloring which is
given to it, the colors being as various as are the
well-known seven sacramental colors employed to
symbolize the seven regions of the world by the
priesthood of these people.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will only add, that the hand symbol painted upon
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>the walls of the estufas, or Kiva temples, or upon the
little sacred sand mounds, which are made to symbolize
mythic mountains of the six regions during the
ceremonials of initiation performed once every four
years over the new children of the pueblo, are designed
to signify the various ritualistic precepts which are
taught to the children according as they are held to
pertain to one or another of these little sand mounds
or so-called mountains of generation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the case above described I was told, although I
did not myself see it, that the symbol of the red hand
was painted by the side of the entrance to the little
tent in which the girl sat through the ceremonials, and
that later the same symbol in black was added to the
other side of the entrance to this tent. In the case
of the Pueblos the position of the hand symbols depends,
as, no doubt, you have already inferred, upon
the sort of ceremonial which is being performed in
connection with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It would seem, however, that the placing of these
symbols at the <em>entrance</em> of the cave villages would
correspond to such usages as I have above described
as pertaining to the Jicarilla ceremonial, and that the
painting of them on the rafters of rooms in ancient
pueblos had a like connection; for it must be remembered
that in the older pueblos there were no
doorways proper [hence no thresholds]. The rooms
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>were entered by means of ladders through scuttles in
the roof.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A hand-print is a signature. A hand-print in blood
is a pledge of life in a sacred covenant. A hand-print
in the blood of life is symbolic of a covenant of life
with a view to the transmission of life. When a woman
of Korea is married, she affixes her sign manual to
the covenanting contract by placing her hand on
the paper and having “the outline drawn round the
fingers and wrist with a fine brush dipped in Chinese
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>ink,” or again she employs “the simpler process of
smearing her hand with black paint, and hitting the
document with it.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Formal documents have often been signed by a
hand stamp, or a finger stamp, in blood or in ink.
The monks of the convent of St. Catharine at Mt.
Sinai, for instance, show a copy of the certificate of
protection given to them by the Prophet of Islam, the
signature to which is an impression of Muhammad’s
open hand. A letter to Muhammad Issoof, from the
king of Mysore, in 1754, was sealed with the king’s seal,
“and on the back was stamped the print of a hand, a
form equivalent, with the Mysoreans, to an oath.”<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The very term “sign manual,” employed for a veritable
signature, may point to an origin in this custom.
Indeed, may it not be that the large red seal attached
to important documents, at the present time, is a survival
of the signature and seal of the bloody hand?</p>

<h3 class='c010'>9. DEITIES OF THE DOORWAY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Originally the covenant sacrifice at the threshold
was with the one God of life. But as monotheism degenerated
into polytheism, the idea came to prevail of
different deities in different portions of the door, or
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>of different deities in different districts of country or
in different offices of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each gate of an Assyrian city was dedicated to a
special god, and named after it,–as the gate of Bel,
the gate of Beltis, the gate of Anu, the gate of Ishtar.
At the entrance-way of every gate gigantic winged
bulls with human heads stood on guard, accompanied
by winged genii.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a> And the central doorway to the
king’s palace was similarly guarded.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a> In every house
a special deity was appealed to at different portions of
the doorway; Nergal on the top of the wall and beneath
the threshold; Ea and Merodach in the passage
to the right and left of the gate.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The idea of an offering, or of a dedication, to the
local divinity, at the time the threshold is laid, is of
wide acceptance. In India, “the god Vāttu, or Vāttuma
[a son of Vishnoo], is said to recline and live in
the threshold, changing his position every month....
On the day when the door-frame and threshold of a
new house or temple are fixed, the <em>Vāttuma santhe</em>
[the tribute to Vāttuma] is offered.”<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In China, “Shintu and Yuhlui are named as two
tutelar gods to whom the guardianship of the house is
entrusted; and either the names or grotesque representations
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>of these ‘gods of the threshold’ are at the
gate of the house, with shrines to them upon the left
of the entrance way.”<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is said of these “Chinese gods of the threshold,”
that “in full stature, and presumably in primeval
strength, they flank the doors of monasteries and the
entrances to the halls of justice. Much reduced in
size and perched high on shelves, they face each other
in the vestibules of the Chinese home; and in their
most diminutive aspect they become little images,
occasionally two-headed, which are carried about the
person as charms, or hang from the eaves of Chinese
houses.”<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Over the doors of almost all the houses of Japan
are to be seen small prints of the “gigantic <em>Ni-o</em>, the
Booddhist Gog and Magog,” who are supposed to
guard the entrance way of the holy places.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a> Private
buildings as well as public need this spiritual protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions at the doorways of the houses of
ancient Egypt showed that every building was “placed
under the protection of a tutelary deity.” This custom
“is retained by the modern Egyptians in the
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>protecting genius said to preside over the different
quarters of Cairo.”<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Tertullian, a Christian Father who wrote before the
close of the second century, in warning believers
against the seducements of idolatry, emphasized the
clustering of deities at the doors and gates in the religions
of Greece and Rome.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a> He says that “among
the Greeks ... we read of Apollo Thyræus (that is,
of the door), and the Antelii (or, Anthelii) demons, as
presiders over entrances;” while among the Romans
there are other “gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess),
called after hinges; and Forculus (Door-god)
after doors; and Limentinus (Threshold-god)
after the threshold; and Janus (Gate-god) himself
after the gate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Although a Christian might not recognize these gods
as gods, he is told to beware lest he seem to give them
honor by adorning his gates with lamps or wreaths.
“Indeed, a Christian will not even dishonor his own
gate with laurel crowns,” says Tertullian, “if so be he
knows how many gods the devil has attached to
doors.” And his words of warning are: “Since there
are beings who are adored in entrances [doorways],
it is to them that both the lamps and laurels will pertain.
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>To an idol you will have done whatever you
shall have done to an entrance [or doorway].” “If
you have renounced [heathen] temples, make not
your own gate a [heathen] temple.” Yet, in proof of
the prevalence of this heathen custom among Christians,
Tertullian testifies: “‘Let your works shine,’
says He; but now all our shops and gates shine!
You will now-a-days find more doors of heathens without
lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In Guatemala, in Central America, “the god of
houses” is called Chahalka; and the blood of sacrifices
to him is sprinkled on the door of the houses as
an assurance of his protection.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was much the same in the Old World as in the
New. In ancient and in modern times, and in widely
different portions of the world, there are indications
that the threshold of the home was the primitive
altar; and that the side-posts and lintel of the doorway
above the threshold bore symbols or inscriptions
in proof of the sacredness of the entrance to the family
home, and in token of an accomplished covenant with
its guardian God, or gods.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>II. <br /> EARLIEST TEMPLE ALTAR.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1. FROM HOUSE TO TEMPLE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A temple is only a more prominent house. As a
house was the dwelling of the earlier priest of his
household, who was in covenant for himself and his
family with the guardian deity of that household;
so, afterwards, a temple was a dwelling for the deity
guarding an aggregation of families, and for the
priests who stood between him and the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is no new or strange truth; it is obvious. “In
the Vedas, Yama, as the first man, is the first priest
too; he brought worship here below as well as life,
and ‘first he stretched out the thread of sacrifice.’”<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
The fire-altar of the home was first the center of worship
in the family in India;<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a> as later the fire-altar was
the center of the worship of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same cuneiform characters in old Babylonian
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>stand for great house, for palace, and for temple;<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a>
as similarly, in ancient Egypt, the same hieroglyph
represented house or temple,–a simple quadrangular
enclosure, with its one doorway.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The oldest form of an Egyptian temple known
to us through the inscriptions of the Ancient Empire
indicates that the prehistoric houses of worship in
that land were mere hovels of wood and lattice-work,
over the doors of which was a barbaric ornamentation
of bent pieces of wood.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> The private house became
the public temple.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The design of the Greek temple in its highest
perfection was ... a gradual development of the
dwelling-house.”<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Palace and temple were, indeed,
often identical in ancient Greece.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Strictly speaking, there were no temples in ancient
Persia, any more than in early India. But the fire-altars
that were first on the home hearth, or threshold,
were made more and more prominent on their uplifted
stepped bases, until they towered loftily in the sight
of their worshipers.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>It is the same Hebrew word, <em>ohel</em>, that stands for the
“tent” of Abraham, and for the “Tent” or Tabernacle
of the congregation of Israel.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In China “temple architecture differs little from
that of the houses.”<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a> The house of a god is as the
house of a man, only grander and more richly ornamented.
And Japanese antiquaries say that the
architecture of Shinto temples is on the model of the
primeval Japanese hut. The temples of Ise, the most
sacred of the Shinto sanctuaries, are said to represent
this primitive architecture in its purest form.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The father of the family was the primitive priest in
the Samoan Islands, and his house was the first place
of worship. Then “the great house of the village,”
or the place of popular assembling, was used as a
temple; and afterwards there were special temple
structures with attendant priests.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c012'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The transition from house to temple seems to have
been a gradual one in the primitive world. The
fire-altar of the family came to be the fire-altar of the
community of families. The house of a king became
both palace and temple, and so again the house of a
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>priest; for the offices of king and of priest were in
early times claimed by the same person.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c012'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. SACREDNESS OF THE DOOR.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In all stages of the transition from house to temple,
the sacredness of the threshold, of the door, of the
entrance-way, of the gate, was recognized in architecture
and in ceremonial. Often the door, or the
gate, stood for the temple, and frequently the threshold
was an altar, or an altar was at the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are, indeed, reasons for supposing that the
very earliest form of a primitive temple, or sanctuary,
or place of worship, was a rude doorway, as covering
or as localizing the threshold altar. This would
seem to be indicated by prehistoric remains in different
parts of the world, as well as in the later development
of the idea in the earlier historic ages. The
only exception to this was where, as in India or Persia,
the fire-altar on an uplifted threshold stood alone as
a place of worship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two upright stone posts, with or without an overlaying
stone across them, and with or without an
altar stone between or before them, are among the
most ancient remains of primitive man’s handiwork;
and a similar design is to be recognized, all the way
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>along in the course of history, down to the elaborate
doorway standing by itself as a memorial of the
revered dead,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c012'><sup>[274]</sup></a> or to the monumental triumphal arch
as an accompaniment of the highest civilization.
And the very name of door, or gate, attaches persistently
to the loftiest temple and to the most exalted
personage. As the earliest altar was the threshold,
the earliest temple was a doorway above the altar at
the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the first dwellers on the plains of Chaldea,
after the Deluge, gathered themselves for the building
of a common structure reaching God-ward,<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a> they,
in their phraseology, called that structure Bab-el, or
Bâb-ilu, or Bâbi-ilu, the Door of God.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> Ancient
Egyptians called the sovereign head of their national
family “<em>Per-ao</em>” (Pharaoh), the exalted House, or
Gate, or Door;<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c012'><sup>[277]</sup></a> as to-day the Sultan, who is spiritual
father of the faithful Muhammadans, and autocrat of
his realm, is widely known as the “Sublime Porte,”
or the Exalted Door.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c012'><sup>[278]</sup></a> The modern Babists, in Persia
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>and beyond, look up to their spiritual head as the
“Bab,” or the “Door.”<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a>  “Throughout the East
this word [‘Bab’] signifies the court of a prince
[as a ruler by divine right].... The threshold of
the gate is used in the same sense, and frequently it
is qualified by some epithet of nobility, loftiness, or
goodness.”<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Jesus Christ did not hesitate to say of himself as
the Way to God: “I am the Door: by me if any man
enter in he shall be saved.”<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In China, Japan, Korea, Siam, and India, a gate, or
doorway, usually stands before Confucian and Booddhist
and Shinto temples, but apart from the temple,
and always recognized as of peculiar sacredness.
These doorways, in many places, are painted blood-color.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
They stand “at the entrance of temple
grounds, in front of shrines and sacred trees, and in
every place associated with the native <em>kami</em>”–or
gods.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Yet, again, in all these countries, the temple
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>gateway is a main feature, or a prominent one, in the
chief sanctuaries.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Swinging doors, or gates, are represented, in the
religious symbolism of ancient Babylonia, as opening
to permit the god Shamash, or the sun, to start out on
his daily circuit of the heavens.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a> A door, or a doorway,
appears as a shrine for a god in various cylinders
from this region; and the god is shown standing
within it, just beyond the threshold.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a> Indeed, the
doorway shrine is a common form on the Babylonian
and the Assyrian monuments, as a standing-place for
the gods, and for the kings as representative of the
gods.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a> Illustrations of this are found on the Balawat
gates,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a> and the sculptures on the rocks at Nahr-el-Kelb<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a>–which
is itself a gateway of the nations, between
the mountains and the sea, on the route between
Egypt and Canaan, and both the East and the West.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>In ancient Egypt the doorway shrine of the gods
was prominent, as in Babylonia.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Moreover, a false
door was represented in the earlier mastabahs, or
tombs, of the Old Empire of Egypt. This representation
of a door was toward the west, in which direction
Osiris, the god of the under-world, was supposed
to enter his realm as the sun went down. On
or around this false door were memorial inscriptions,
and prayers for the dead; and before it was a table,
or altar, for offerings to the <em>ka</em>, or soul, of the dead.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a>
Gradually this false door came to be recognized as
the monumental slab, tablet, or stele, on which were
inscribed the memorials of the deceased. As a doorway
or a niche, square-topped, or arched, it was the
shrine of the one worshiped; and as a panel, or independent
stele, it was the place of record of the object
of reverence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Even at the beginning of the Middle Empire the
door form disappeared completely, and the whole
space of the stone was taken up with the representation
of the deceased sitting before a table of offerings,
receiving gifts from his relatives and servants. Soon
afterwards it became the custom to round off the stone
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>at the top, and when, under the New Empire, pictures
of a purely religious character took the place of the
former representations, no one looking at the tomb
stele could have guessed that it originated from the
false door.”<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A “false door” was, in ancient Egypt, a valued gift
from a sovereign to an honored subject. Doors of
this kind were sometimes richly carved and painted,
and were deemed of priceless value by the recipient.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Phenicia,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a> Carthage,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a> Cyprus,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a> Sardinia,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a> Sicily,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a>
and in Abyssinia,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a> a like prominence was given to the
door as a door, in temple and in tomb, and as a niche
for the figure of a deity or for the representation of
one who had crossed the threshold of the new life.
And the door-form is a sacred memorial of the dead
in primitive lands in various parts of the world, from
the rudest trilithon to the more finished structures of
a high civilization.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In primitive New Zealand the gateway, or doorway,
of a village, a cemetery, or a public building, is both
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>a sacred image and a sacred passage-way. It is in the
form of a superhuman personage, and it has its guardians
on either hand.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A doorway with an altar between its posts was a
symbol of religious worship in ancient Mexico, as in
the far East.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem that the “mihrab,” or prayer niche,
pointing toward Meccah, in Muhammadan lands, and
the Chinese honorary portals and ancestral tablets,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a> as
well as the niches for images of saints in churches or
at wayside shrines, or for heroes in public halls, in
Christian lands, are a survival of the primitive doorway
in a tomb.</p>

<p class='c000'>And wherever the door is prominent as a door, the
threshold is recognized and honored as the floor of
the door, and as the primitive altar above which the
door is erected. To pass through the door is to cross
over the threshold of the door.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN ASIA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In all the modern excavations in the region of
Babylonia and Assyria, including Tello, Nippur, Sippara,
Borsippa, Khorsabad, and Nineveh, it has been
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>found that the threshold, or foundation-stone, of the
temple doorway is marked with inscriptions that show
its peculiar sanctity; while underneath it, or near it,
are frequently buried images and symbols and other
treasures in evidence of its altar-like sacredness. On
this point evidence has been furnished by Botta,<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
Bonomi,<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a> Layard,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a> George Smith,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> Lenormant,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and
yet more fully by Dr. Hilprecht, in his later and current
researches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bonomi suggests that the word “teraphim,” as
an image of a household divinity, has its connection
with the threshold or the boundary limit; and that the
phrase “thy going out, and thy coming in,” which is
common in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Hebrew<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a> literature,
has reference to the threshold and its protecting
deities.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a> The outgoing and the incoming are
clearly across the threshold and through the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inscriptions of Nebuchadrezzar II., concerning
his building of the walls of Babylon, comprise various
references to the foundations, to the thresholds, and
to their guardians. He says: “On the thresholds of
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>the gates I set up mighty bulls of bronze, and mighty
snakes standing upright.”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a> Again of the gates of
Imgur-Bêl and Nimitti-Bel, of these walls of Babylon,
he says: “Their foundations I laid at the surface
(down at) the water, with pitch and bricks. With
blue enameled tiles which were adorned with bulls
and large snakes, I built their interior cleverly. Strong
cedars I laid over them as their covering (or roof).
Doors of cedarwood with a covering of copper, a
threshold (<em>askuppu</em>) and hinges of bronze, I set up
in their gates. Strong bulls of bronze, and powerful
snakes standing upright, I set upon (or at) their threshold
(<em>sippu</em>). Those gates I filled with splendor for
the astonishment of all mankind.”<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In a similar manner Nebuchadrezzar describes his
work at the gates of “the royal castle of all mankind,”
at Babylon,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a> and of his palace.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> In connection
with the shrine or chapel of Nebo (Ezida), within the
walls of the temple of Merodach, in Babylon, he says:
“Its threshold (<em>sippu</em>), its lock and its key, I plated
with gold, and made the temple shine daylike.”<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a> When
he built Ezida (the “eternal house”), the temple of
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Borsippa, Nebuchadrezzar says: “The bulls and the
doors of the gate of the sanctuary, the threshold
(<em>sippu</em>), the lock, the hinge, I plated with <em>zarîru</em>”<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
(an unknown metal, a kind of bronze).</p>

<p class='c000'>References to the foundations, to the thresholds, to
the gates and doorways, and to bulls and upright
serpents, as the guardians of the threshold of the temples
and palaces of Babylonia and Assyria, are numerous
on unearthed cylinders and tablets, and always in
such a way as to indicate their peculiar sacredness.
In the recent unearthing, at Nippur, of a small building
or shrine, between two great temples, an altar was
found in the eastern doorway.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be borne in mind that many early temples
in Babylonia, as in Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in Mexico,
Central America, and Peru, and in the South Sea
Islands, were in the form of a stepped pyramid, or a
staged tower, with either inclined planes or stairways
from each lower stage to the next higher, and with
an altar, or a sanctuary or shrine, at the summit.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a>
Herodotus, describing one of these temples in Babylon,
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>says that the altars, larger and smaller, were outside
the temple.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Light is thrown on the dream of Jacob at Bethel by
the shape of the ancient temple in the East. In his
vision it was probably not a ladder, but a conventional
stepped-temple structure, with its stairways rising
heavenward, and its sanctuary, that Jacob saw.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a> The
angel ministers were passing up and down the steps,
in the service of the Most High God, who himself
appeared above the structure. When Jacob waked
he said: “Surely the Lord is in this place [or sanctuary];
and I knew it not.... How dreadful is this
place! this is none other but the house of God, and
this is the gate of heaven;” and he took the stone
which had been his pillow at the threshold of that
sanctuary, and set it up for an altar pillar.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the literature and legends of Babylonia, as of
other portions of the ancient world, there is prominent
the idea that an entrance into the life beyond this, as in
the entrance into this life, the crossing of a threshold
from the one world to the other, from the earlier state
and the passing of a door, or gate, marks the change
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>to the later, from the sacred to the more sacred.
This is peculiarly illustrated in the famous legend of
Ishtar’s descent into the under-world in order to bring
back to earth her lover Dumuzi.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Hades of the Babylonians was surrounded by
seven high walls, and was approached through seven
gates, each of which was guarded by a pitiless warder.
Two deities ruled within it–Nergal, “the lord of the
great city,” and Beltis-Allat, “the lady of the great
land,”–whither everything which had breathed in this
world descended after death. Allat was the actual
sovereign of the country; and even the gods themselves
could enter her realm only on the condition of
submitting to death, like mortals, and of humbly
avowing themselves her slaves.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a> “The <em>threshold</em> of
Allat’s palace stood upon a spring, which had the
property of restoring to life all who bathed in it or
drank of its waters.” Yet it was needful that another
life should be given for one who would be reborn into
this life, after crossing the threshold of the regions
beyond.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the descent of the goddess Ishtar into Allat’s
realm, in pursuit of her lover Dumuzi, Ishtar was
gradually stripped of her garments and adornings at
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>the successive gates, until she appeared naked, as at
birth, at the final threshold of the new state.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a> But she
was held captive by Allat until Ea, chief among the
gods, exerted himself in her behalf, and sent his messenger
to secure for both Ishtar and Dumuzi the
waters of life which were underneath the threshold
of Allat’s realm,–which must be broken in order to
their outflowing.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There would seem to be a reference to this primitive
idea of the waters of life flowing from under the
threshold of the temple, in the vision of the prophet
Ezekiel, writing in Babylonia, concerning restored
Jerusalem and its holy temple. “Behold, waters
issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward,
for the forefront of the house was toward the
east: and the waters came down from under, from the
right side of the house, on the south of the altar.”
(Evidently the altar in this temple was near the threshold.)
These flowing waters from under the threshold
were life-giving. “Upon the bank of the river,” as it
swelled in its progress, “were very many trees on the
one side and on the other;” and it was said of this
stream: “It shall come to pass, that every living creature
which swarmeth, in every place whither the rivers
come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish:
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>for these waters are come thither, ... and
every thing shall live whithersoever the river cometh.”<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
In a curse pronounced against Assyria by the prophet
Zephaniah, it was declared that “drought shall be in
the thresholds,”<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a> instead of life-giving waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, again, the waters of the life-giving Jordan flow
out from the threshold of the grotto of Pan, a god
of life.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a> And both at the beginning of the Old Testament,
and at the close of the New, the waters of life
start from the sanctuary of the Author of life.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This Dumuzi of Babylonia has linkings with Tammuz
of Syria, with Osiris of Egypt, and with Adonis
of Greece, and there are correspondences in all these
legends in the references to the door and the threshold
of the under-world and the life beyond. Thus, for
instance, the Lord’s prophet counts as most heinous
of all idolatries the transfer of the weeping worship of
Tammuz from the door in the hole of the temple wall
to the door of the temple sanctuary.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the right hand of the entrance of the larger
temple unearthed at Nineveh by Layard, a sculptured
image of the Assyrian king, with his arm uplifted,
was on a doorway stele just outside. And an
altar for offerings was in front of that image. Altars</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>were found similarly situated, just outside the doorway,
in a smaller temple in the same region.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An exceptional reverence is shown to the doorway
and threshold of their sanctuary, or temple, by the
sect of the Yezidis, in the neighborhood of ancient
Nineveh, at the present time. Describing an evening
service which he attended, Layard says: “When the
prayers were ended, those who marched in procession
kissed, as they passed by, the right side of the
doorway leading into the temple, where a serpent is
figured on the wall.” Again, “Soon after sunrise, on
the following morning, the sheikhs and cawals offered
up a short prayer in the court of the temple.... Some
prayed in the sanctuary, frequently kissing the threshold
and holy places within the building.”<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When the sacred ark of the Hebrews was captured
by the Philistines, and brought into the house of the
god Dagon, the record is: “When they of Ashdod
arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen
upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his
place again. And when they arose early on the morrow
morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face
to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the
head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>cut off upon the threshold.” It is added, in our
present Bible text: “Therefore neither the priests of
Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on
the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.”<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem, from the words “unto this day,”
that this added statement was a gloss by a later writer
or copyist. The original force of the wonder was in
Dagon’s being overthrown at his very shrine, falling
maimed on the threshold altar of his temple. But the
suggestion of the gloss is that the unwillingness of
the Philistines to tread on the threshold of the temple
(which appears to have been of primitive origin) did
not exist among the worshipers of Dagon prior to
this incident. The Septuagint adds,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a> concerning the
later practice of the Philistines at the threshold, “because
leaping they leap over it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaping over the threshold is at times spoken of in
the Bible as if it had a taint of idolatry. Thus Zephaniah,
foretelling, in the name of the Lord, the divine
judgments on idolaters, says: “In that day I will
punish all those that leap over the threshold.”<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a> This
is explained in the Targum as “those that walk in the
customs of the Philistines.” Yet the Bible sometimes
refers to the temple threshold as a fitting place
of worship, and its recognition as a holy altar as commendable.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>Ezekiel prophesies that the restored Prince of
Israel “shall worship at the threshold of the gate”<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a>
of the Lord’s house; and he sees, in vision, “the
glory of the Lord ... over the threshold of the
house.”<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a> Again the Lord complains of the profanation
of his temple by idolaters “in their setting of
their threshold by my threshold, and their door-post
beside my door-post, and there was but the wall between
me and them.”<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That it was the threshold or doorway of the tabernacle
which was counted sacred, is evident from the
wording of the Levitical laws concerning the offering
of blood in sacrifices. “This is the thing which the
Lord hath commanded, saying, What man soever
there be of the house of Israel, that killeth an ox, or
lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it without
the camp, and hath not brought it <em>unto the door of the
tent of meeting</em>, to offer it as an oblation unto the
Lord before the tabernacle of the Lord: blood shall
be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and
that man shall be cut off from among his people: to
the end that the children of Israel may bring their
sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field, even
that they may bring them unto the Lord, <em>unto the
door of the tent of meeting</em>, unto the priest, and sacrifice
them for sacrifices of peace offerings unto the Lord.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>And the priest shall sprinkle the blood <em>upon the altar
of the Lord at the door of the tent of meeting</em>, and burn
the fat for a sweet savour unto the Lord.... Whatsoever
man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among them, that offereth a
burnt offering or sacrifice, and bringeth it not <em>unto
the door of the tent of meeting</em>, to sacrifice it unto the
Lord; even that man shall be cut off from his people.”<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It was <em>at the doorway</em> of the tent of meeting that
Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the holy
priesthood;<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a> and it was there that the bullock was
sacrificed, and its blood was poured out as an offering
at the base of the altar.<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a> It was <em>at the doorway</em> of
that tent, above the threshold, that the pillar of cloud
descended in token of the Lord’s presence, when
Moses met the Lord there in loving communion,
while the people stood watching from the doorways
of their own tents.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a> The altar of burnt offering, at the
base or foundation of which the blood of the offerings
was outpoured, was itself at the doorway of the tent
of meeting, and he who offered a sacrifice to the Lord
offered it at that threshold.<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A post of honor in the temple was as a guardian of
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>the threshold, as was also the place of a keeper of the
gate. In the assignment of the priests and Levites to
service, by Jehoiada the priest, in the days of Athaliah,
a third part of them were in attendance at the
“threshold,” and a third part “at the gate of the
foundation.”<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a> Later, in the days of Josiah and Hilkiah,
the guardians of the threshold had the care of
the money collected for the repairs of the Lord’s
house.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c012'><sup>[344]</sup></a> And a keeper of the threshold, or of the
door, of the house of God, was always mentioned with
honor.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c012'><sup>[345]</sup></a> When the Psalmist contrasts the house of
God with the tents of wickedness, he speaks of the
honor of a post at the temple threshold, not of the
humble place of a temple janitor, when he says:</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Temple at Jerusalem, the altar of burnt offering
was before the threshold of the Holy Place; and
those who came with sacrifices must stop at that
threshold, and proffer the blood of their offering to
the priests, who then reverently poured it out at the
altar-threshold’s base.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>When offerings were accepted for the repairs of the
temple, in the days of Jehoash, king of Judah, it is
said that “Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored
a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on
the right side as one cometh into the house of the
Lord. And the priests that kept [or guarded] the
threshold put therein all the money that was brought
into the house of the Lord.”<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a> This would seem to
decide the position of the altar as at the threshold,
where “one cometh into the house of the Lord.”</p>

<p class='c000'>An altar stood at the doorway, or before the door,
of temples of later date in Phenicia and Phrygia, as
shown on contemporary medals and coins.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a> And so
in temples in other lands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the early Christian remains unearthed in
Asia Minor are indications of the former position of
an altar on the threshold of a sanctuary. At the site
of ancient Aphrodisias, “some of the sarcophagi of the
Byzantine age are richly wrought, and although many
are of Christian date, they appear to have retained the
pagan devices.” At the end of one of these sarcophagi
“appears an altar burning in front of a door,”
standing indeed on the very threshold.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>An oath of peculiar sacredness among Hindoos is
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>at the threshold of a temple, as at its primal altar.
“Is a man accused of a great crime? He goes to the
temple [threshold], makes his prostrations; he pauses,
then steps over it, declaring at the same time that he is
not guilty of the crime laid to his charge. It is therefore
very common to ask a person who denies anything

<p class='c000'>Among the stories told in India of judgments at the
temple threshold, is one of a thieving goldsmith, who
had secreted himself in a pagoda of Vishnoo, in order
to take from the sacred image one of its jewel eyes.
Having obtained the precious stone, he waited for the
opening of the pagoda doors in the morning, in order
to escape with his booty. But as he attempted to
cross the threshold, when the door was opened, he
was stricken with death by Vishnoo “at the very
threshold.”<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a> Justice was administered at the very seat
of justice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bloody sacrifices are still known at the temple
thresholds in India, notwithstanding the prejudice of
Hindoos against the shedding of blood. Within
recent times an English gentleman, in an official position
in India, discovered a decapitated child at the
very door of a celebrated pagoda; and an investigation
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>showed that a father had there sacrificed his son
to avert an impending evil.<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When a famous idol was destroyed in the temple
of Somnauth, during the Muhammadan conquest of
India, pieces of the shattered image were sent by the
conquerors to the mosks of Meccah, Medina, and
Ghuznee, to be thrown down at the thresholds of
their gates, there to be trodden under foot by devout
and zealous Mussulmans.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a> The accursed idol fragments
might be trampled on at the threshold, even
while the threshold itself was counted sacred.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Muhammadan mosks generally the threshold is
counted sacred. Across the threshold proper, at the
beginning of the sacred portion of the interior, “is a
low barrier, a few inches high.”<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a> Before this barrier
the worshiper stops, removes his shoes, and steps over
it, with the right foot first. In some smaller mosks a
rod above the outer door-sill stands for this barrier.</p>

<p class='c000'>Describing his visit to one of the mosks in Persia,
Morier says: “Here we remarked the veneration of
the Persians for the threshold of a holy place....
Before they ventured to cross it, they knelt down and
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>kissed it, whilst they were very careful not to touch
it with their feet.”<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the tomb of the kings of Persia, at Com, the inscription
appears: “Happy and glorious the believing
one who in reverence bows his head upon the threshold
of this gate, in imitation of the sun and moon.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
All that <em>he</em> will ask with faith in this gate, shall be as
the arrow that reaches the mark.”<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a> And on the
tomb of Alee, son-in-law of Muhammad and one of
his successors, there stands the declaration: “The
angel messenger of the truth, Gabriel, kisses every day
the threshold of thy gate; for that is the only way by
which one can come to the throne of Muhammad.”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Even among Christians in this primitive region, this
reverence for the threshold as the earliest altar of the
temple and the church manifests itself in various ways.
Dr. Grant, an American missionary, tells of seeing the
Nestorian Christians kissing the threshold of the
church on entering the sanctuary for the Lord’s Day
service.<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c012'><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At Baveddeen, near Bokhara, is the tomb of Baha-ed-deen
Nakishbend, the national saint of Turkestan,
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>which is a place of pilgrimage second only to the
tomb of Muhammad. “In the front of the tomb,” as
a threshold, “is the famous <em>senghi murad</em>,” the “stone
of desire,” “which has been tolerably ground away,
and made smooth, by the numerous foreheads of pious
pilgrims that have been rubbed upon it.”<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c012'><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A peculiar sacrifice in Tibet is the disemboweling
of a devotee in the presence of a great multitude, as
an act of worship. An altar on which this act is performed
is erected for the occasion “in front of the
temple gate.”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c012'><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the more sacred shrines of Japan and Korea,
Shinto or Booddhist temples, pilgrim worshipers are
permitted to go no farther than the threshold of the
inner sanctuary. There they may deposit their offerings
and may prostrate themselves in prayer, but they
cannot pass beyond.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Kitzuki, “the most ancient shrine of Japan,”
multitudes of pilgrims gather for worship. They are
coming and going ceaselessly, but all pause before
the threshold of the inner sanctuary. “None enter
there: all stand before the dragon-swarming doorway,
and cast their offerings into the money-chest
placed before the threshold; many making contributions
of small coin, the very poorest throwing only a
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>handful of rice into the box. Then they clap their
hands, and bow their heads before the threshold, and
reverently gaze through the hall of prayer at the
loftier edifice, the holy of holies beyond it. Each
pilgrim remains but a little while, and claps his hands
but four times; yet so many are coming and going
that the sound of the clapping is like the sound of a
cataract.”<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a> The same is true of “the great Shrines
of Isé, chief Mecca of the Shintō faith,”<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c012'><sup>[364]</sup></a> of those of
famous Nikkō, and of other centers of worship.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c012'><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN AFRICA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The oldest temple discovered in Egypt is little
more than a doorway with an altar at its threshold,
and with a stele on either side of the altar. This
temple is near the base of the stepped pyramid of
Meydoom, dating back probably to the beginning of
the fourth dynasty.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Later, in Egypt, as in early Babylonia, the doorway,
above the threshold, had peculiar sacredness, in
the temples and in the approaches to the under-world.
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>The pylon, or propylon, of an Egyptian temple, was a
monumental gateway before the temple, and exalted
honor attached to it. It frequently gave its name to
the entire temple.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a> The side towers of this gateway
are said to have represented Isis and Nephthys, and
the door itself between these towers stood for Osiris,
the judge of the living and the dead.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There was indeed a temple in Thebes which bore
the name of “Silver Threshold.” This temple “is
mentioned in the time of the twenty-first dynasty;
and it cannot have been earlier than the eighteenth
dynasty, when silver was growing cheaper in Egypt.”<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a>
But the prominence of the “threshold” in the designation
of the “temple” is aside from the question of
the time of the use of silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The winged sun disk was placed above all the
doors into the temples, that the image of Horus
might drive away all unclean spirits from the sacred
building.”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a> These overshadowing wings marked the
special sacredness of the doors beneath them.</p>

<p class='c000'>When an Egyptian priest opened the door of the
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>shrine–the holy of holies of the temple–he must
prostrate himself at the threshold in reverent worship.
“According to the Theban rite, ... as soon as he saw
the image of the god he had to ‘kiss the ground,
throw himself on his face, throw himself entirely on
his face, kiss the ground with his face turned downward,
offer incense,’ and then greet the god with a
short petition.”<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a> This priestly worship was at the
threshold of the shrine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Egyptian idea of the future life, and of the
world beyond this, had marked correspondences with
the Babylonian. Osiris presided over the under-world,
as, indeed, he was the chief object of worship in this.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
He had been slain in a conflict with evil, and in his
new life he was the friend and helper of those who
struggled against evil.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a> He was in a peculiar sense
the door of the life beyond this, “Osiris, opening the
ways of the two worlds;”<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and those who passed
that door safely were identified with himself in the
under-world.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A closed door toward the west, in a tomb, represented
the deceased on his way to Osiris.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c012'><sup>[376]</sup></a> And as
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>shown in the “Book of the Dead” the approach to Osiris
was by a series of doors, which could be passed only
by one who showed his identification with Osiris, and
his worthiness as such.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a> At the entrance to the Hall
of the Two Truths, or of the Two-fold Maāt,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a> as the
place of final judgment, the deceased was challenged
by the threshold of the door, by the two side-posts, by
the lock, by the key, and by the door itself; and he
could not pass these unless he proved his oneness with
Osiris by his knowledge of their names severally.<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A saint’s tomb, called a <em>wely</em>, is a common place of
worship in Egypt. Sometimes a mosk is built over
it, and sometimes it serves as a substitute for a mosk,
where no mosk is near. “At least one such building
forms a conspicuous object close by, or within, almost
every Arab village;” and these tombs are frequently
visited by those who would make supplication for
themselves, or intercession for others, or who would
do a worthy act, and merit a correspondent blessing.
“Many a visitor, on entering the tomb, kisses the
threshold, or touches it with his right hand, which he
then kisses.”<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Similar customs prevail in Arabia and
Syria.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>At Carthage, which was a Phenician colony but
which impressed its character on northern Africa, the
chief  temple gave prominence  to the threshold,  rising
in  steps as an altar before  a statue of the Queen
of Heaven. Virgil, describing the arrival of Æneas
at the court of Queen Dido, says:</p>

<p class='c000'>The churches of Abyssinia always stand on a hill,
and in a grove–like the temple at Carthage. “When
you go to the church you put off your shoes before
your first entering the outer precinct.... At entry,
you kiss the threshold and two door-posts, go in and
say what prayer you please; that finished you come
out again, and your duty is over.”<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>The yard of an Abyssinian church has been compared
to “the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucus</span></em> or sacred grove of the pagan temple.”
“The church itself is square, and built of stone
with beams stuck in to support them. At the porch,
the wooden lintels, which the pious kiss with intense
earnestness,–in fact, kissing the walls and lintels of a
church is a great feature in Abyssinian devotion, so
much so that, instead of speaking of ‘going to church,’
they say ‘kissing the church,’–are carved with quaint
and elaborate devices.”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At Yeha, near Aksum, are the remains of a ruined
temple, within the area of which a church was at one
time built. “In front of the vestibule stood two rude
monoliths, at the base of one of which is an altar with
a circular disk on it, presumably, from the analogy of
those at Aksum, for receiving the blood of slaughtered
victims.” Obviously, the altar of this temple was at
its threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Marriages are said to be celebrated in Abyssinia at
the church door–the wedding covenant being thus
made before the threshold altar.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And so in the earlier temples of Egypt, of Carthage,
and of Abyssinia, and in Christian and Muhammadan
places of worship, the doorway is held sacred, and,
most of all, the threshold, or “floor of the door.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>5. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN EUROPE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Traces of the primitive sacredness of the doorway
and the threshold, in places of worship, are to be
found in Europe, ancient and modern, as in Asia and
Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term “threshold” occurs in such prominence
in connection with temples, in the earliest Greek literature,
as to show that its primitive meaning included
the idea of altar, or of sanctuary foundation. Thus
the House of Zeus on Olympus is repeatedly spoken
of as the “House of the Bronze Threshold.”<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a> In
these references, “the nature of the occurrences, the
uniformity of the phrase, the position of the words in
the verse, all point to this as an old hieratic phrase,
and the meaning evidently is, ‘the house that is stablished
forever.’”<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This term “bronze threshold” occurs more than
once in reference to the temple-palace of Alcinoüs.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
Tartarus is described as having gates of iron and a
“bronze threshold.”<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a> Night and day meet as they
cross the “great threshold of bronze;” and Atlas upholds
heaven at the threshold of the under-world.<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>The treasures of Delphi are described as “within
the stone threshold of the archer god, Phoebus Apollo,
in Rocky Pytho.”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> And he who seeks counsel at that
oracle is spoken of as one who crosses “the stone
threshold.”<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c012'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Sophocles’ “Oedipus at Colonus” the Athenian
warns the stranger Oedipus that he is on holy ground,
in the realm of Poseidon, and that the spot where he
now treads is “called the brazen threshold of the
land, the stay of Athens.”<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a> In other words, the
bronze threshold is an archaic synonym for the enduring
border, or outer limit, of spiritual domain.</p>

<p class='c000'>This prominence given to the threshold in earlier
Greek literature is not, it is true, continued in later
writings; yet there are traces of it still in occasional
poetic references to the “threshold of life,” and the
“threshold of the year,” and the “threshold of old
age.” When Homer refers “to houses, to rooms in
houses, or to courtyards, the ‘threshold’ is constantly
spoken of: a man steps over a threshold, stands at a
threshold, sits at a threshold, etc. And so important
is the threshold that its material is almost regularly
mentioned; it is ash, oak, stone, bronze, etc. In later
times all these locutions disappear; men go through
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>doorways, enter, stand in porches, etc., instead.”<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> Yet
it is the archaic use that points to the primitive prominence
of the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>In historic times, however, as in earlier, the altar of
sacrifice was to be found, in Grecian and Roman
temples, near the threshold of the door. While there
were smaller altars, for the offering of incense and
bloodless sacrifices, in the interior of temples, the
larger and more important altars, for the offering of
animal sacrifices, whether of beasts or of men, were
before the temple, in front of the threshold,–<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bomoi
pronaoi</span></em>.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c012'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A ruined temple of Artemis Propylæa, at Eleusis,
shows the main altar immediately before the threshold,
between the antæ. The altar of the temple of
Apollo at Delphi was in a like position; as shown in
the fact that “when Neoptolemus is attacked by
Orestes in the vestibule of the temple at Delphi, he
seizes the arms which were suspended by means of
nails or pins from one of the antæ, takes his station
upon the altar, and addresses the people in his own
defense.”<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When the “priest of Jupiter, whose temple was
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>before the city” of Lystra, would have given divine
honors to Paul and Barnabas, he brought the garlanded
oxen “unto the gates,” to sacrifice them there.
At the gate of the city, within which the supposed gods
were to be found, seemed the proper place of sacrifice.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There are references in classic story, as in Babylonian
legends, in Phenician and Syrian beliefs, and in
the Hebrew prophetic visions, to life-giving waters
flowing out from under the threshold of the sanctuary.
In the garden of the palace-temple of Alcinoüs “are
two springs, the one ripples through the whole garden,
the other opposite it gushes under the threshold
of the courtyard to the lofty house, and from it the
citizens draw their water.”<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> On “the apple-growing
shores of the Hesperides,” where Atlas upholds “the
holy threshold of heaven,” according to the poets,
“springs of ambrosia pour from the chamber of Zeus,
from his bedside,” and give a rich blessing to the life-giving
earth.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a> And of Delphi it is said: “Going toward
the temple we come upon the spring Cassotis:
there is a low wall about it, and you ascend to the
spring through the walls. The water of this Cassotis
they say sinks underground, and in the shrine of the
god [Apollo] makes the woman prophetic [is inspiration
to her.]”<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>In the early churches of Europe, the threshold
marked a sacred boundary of the edifice, to cross
which indicated a certain covenant right to participate
in the privileges of the house of God. As the structure
of the churches changed, in the progress of the
centuries, the threshold of the sanctuary came to be
in a different portion of the building, or series of buildings;
but its sacredness remained, wherever it was
supposed to be. The term “altar” also changed, from
the border line of the place of worship, to the holy
table within the sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Speaking of the growth of the early church buildings,
Bingham says: “In the strictest sense, including
only the buildings within the walls, they were commonly
divided into three parts: (1.) The <em>narthex</em> or
ante-temple, where the penitents and catechumens
stood. (2.) The <em>naos</em> or temple, where the communicants
had their respective places. And (3.) the <i>bēma</i>
or sanctuary, where the clergy stood to officiate at
the altar. But in a larger sense there was another
ante-temple or <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">narthex</span></em> without the walls, under which
was comprised the propylæa, or <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestibulum</span></em>, the outward
porch; then the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">atrium</span></em> or area, the court leading
from that to the temple, surrounded with porticos
or cloisters.... There were also several <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedræ</span></em>, such
as the baptistery, the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">diaconicum</span></em>, the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pastophoria</span></em>, and
other adjacent buildings, which were reckoned to be
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>either without or within the church, according as it
was taken in a stricter or a larger acceptation.”<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the early churches, the place of baptism was outside
of the church proper, or the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">naos</span></em>, it is said.
“There is nothing more certain than that for many
ages the baptistery was a distinct place from the body
of the church, and reckoned among the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">exedræ</span></em>, or
places adjoining to the church.”<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a>  “The first  ages  all
agreed in this, that, whether they had baptisteries or
not, the place of baptism was always without the
church.”<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a> Even in mediæval times, in the churches
of England, baptisms were on the outer side of the
threshold of the church proper, “the child being held
without the doors of the church”<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a> until baptized. In
many churches of Europe at the present time the baptismal
font is at or near the door of the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1661, a formal reply of the Church of England
bishops to a request of the Presbyterians that the
font might be placed before the congregation, that all
might see it, was: “The font usually stands, as it did
in primitive times, at or near the church door, to
signify that baptism was the entrance into the church
mystical.”<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>Marriages, like baptisms, were at the church porch
or outside of the threshold. “The old missals direct
the placing of the man and the woman at the church
door during the service, and that at the end of it
they shall proceed within up to the altar.”<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The
idea would seem to be that a holy covenant like
marriage, which is the foundation of a new family,
must be solemnized at the primitive family altar,–the
threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Describing the marriage rites of Germany in the
middle ages, Baring-Gould says:  “In a Ritual of
Rennes, of the eleventh century, we find a rubric to
this effect: ‘The priest shall go before the door of the
church in surplice and stole, and ask the bridegroom
and bride prudently whether they desire to be legally
united; and then he shall make the parents give her
away, according to the usual custom, and the bridegroom
shall fix the dower, announcing before all
present what (witthum) he intends to give the bride.
Then the priest shall make him betroth her with a
ring, and give her an honorarium of gold or silver
according to his means. Then let him give the prescribed
benediction. After which, entering into the
church, let him begin mass; and let the bridegroom
and bride hold lighted candles, and make an oblation
at the offertory; and before the Pax let the priest
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>bless them before the altar under a pall or other covering
[the wedding canopy], according to custom; and
lastly, let the bridegroom receive the kiss of peace
from the priest, and pass it on to his bride.’”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“In ancient times the people of France were married,
not within the church at the altar as now, but at the
outer door. This was the case in 1599, in which year
Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry II., was married to
Philip II. of Spain; and the Bishop of Paris performed
the ceremony at the door of the cathedral of Notre
Dame. Another instance of this kind occurred in
1599 in France. Henrietta Maria was married to
King Charles by proxy at the door of Notre Dame,
and the bride, as soon as the ceremony was over
entered the church, and assisted at [attended] mass.”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“The pre-Reformation rule was to begin the marriage
service at the door of the church. In his ‘Wyf
of Bathe,’ Chaucer [in the days of Edward III.] refers
to this custom:–</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Housbandes atte chirche dore I have had fyve.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This old usage was abandoned by authority in the
time of Edward VI. Yet there is reason for thinking
that it was not entirely given up. “There is a poem
of Herrick’s, written about 1640, which is entitled,
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>‘The Entertainment or Porch Verse at the Marriage
of Mr. Hen. Northly.’”<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c012'><sup>[409]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“When Edward I. married Marguerite of France,
in 1299, he endowed her at the door of Canterbury
Cathedral.” Selden declares that “dower could be
lawfully assigned only at the door;” and Littleton
affirms to the same effect.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c012'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“At Witham in Essex it is, or was, the custom to
perform the first part of the marriage service at the
font [near the door]. When the Rev. A. Snell was
appointed to the benefice in 1873, he spoke to a bridegroom
about this usage, and he (the bridegroom)
particularly requested that he might be married at
the font, as he liked old customs.”<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Another survival of the primitive rite of threshold
covenanting seems to be shown in certain customs
observed in various parts of Europe, which look like
the substitution of an altar-stone for a threshold altar,
in the marriage ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thus in the old temple of Upsal [in Sweden],
wedding couples stood upon a broad stone which was
believed to cover the tomb of St. Eric.”<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a> Corresponding
customs in other regions would go to show
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>that the earlier practice was to leap over the stone,
as a mode of threshold covenanting, instead of standing
on it. The latter was a change without a reason
for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For instance, just outside “the ruined church, or
abbey, of Lindisfarne, is the socket or foot-stone, in
which was mortised a ponderous stone cross, erected
by Ethelwold, and broken down by the Danes. This
socket stone is now called the “petting stone,” and
whenever a marriage is solemnized in the neighborhood,
after the ceremony the bride is obliged to step
upon it; and if she cannot stride to the end thereof,
the marriage is deemed likely to prove unfortunate
and fruitless.” While this would seem to point to the
custom of standing upon the stone, in the modern
marriage customs of the same region, a barrier is
“erected at the churchyard gate, consisting of a large
paving-stone which was placed on its edge and supported
by two smaller stones. On either side stood a
villager, who made the couple and every one else
jump over it.”<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“In Lantevit Major Church was a stone called the
‘marriage stone,’ with many knots and flourishes,
and the head of a person upon it, and this inscription:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Ne Petra calcetur</em></span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Qu[a]e subjacet ista tuetur</em>,</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>Brides usually stood upon this stone at their marriages.”<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c012'><sup>[414]</sup></a>
Yet the inscription itself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Let not the stone be trodden upon;</div>
      <div class='line'>What it lies under, it guards,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>forbids standing upon this threshold altar; and it is
probable that in earlier times it was stepped over in
marriage covenant, and not upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>At Belford, in Northumberland, it is still the custom
to make the bridal pair, with their attendants, leap
over a stone placed in their path outside the church
porch. This stone also is called the “petting stone,”
or the “louping stone.” At the neighboring village
of Embleton, in the same county, two stout young
lads place a wooden bench across the door of the
church porch, and assist the bride and groom and
their attendants to surmount the obstacle; for which
assistance a gift of money is expected. In some
places a stick has been held by the groomsmen at
the church door for the bride to jump over. And
again a stool has been placed at the churchyard gate,
over which the whole bridal party must jump one
by one; and this stool has been called the “parting-stool.”<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A “mode of marriage” current in Ireland, until
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>recent times, was that of jumping over a form of the
cross;<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> and jumping over a broomstick as a form of
marriage would seem to be a survival of this custom
of leaping across the threshold-stone, in token of a
covenant. “Jumping the broomstick” is sometimes
spoken of as an equivalent of marriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>These various obstacles to progress, at wedding
time, would seem to be as suggestions of the threshold
altar, which must be passed in the marriage covenant.
The church threshold, like the home threshold,
is a temporary hindrance to an advance. Unless it is
stepped across, the covenant is incomplete.</p>

<p class='c000'>An illustration of the popular idea of the sacredness
of the church threshold, and of the impropriety of
stepping on it, in its passing, is found in a Finnish
mode of judging a clergyman. “In Finland, it is
regarded as unlucky if a clergyman steps on the
threshold, when he comes to preach at a church.” A
writer on this subject says: “A Finnish friend told
me of one of his relations going to preach at a church,
a few years ago,–he being a candidate for the vacant
living,–and the people most anxiously watched if he
stepped on the threshold as he came in. Had he
done so, I fear a sermon never so eloquent would
have counted but little against so dire an omen.”<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>Here is a new peril for pulpit candidates, if this primitive
test becomes widely popular!</p>

<p class='c000'>Even to the present time, it is customary, in portions
of Europe, for Jews to rub their fingers on the
posts of a synagogue doorway, and then kiss their
fingers. Quite an indentation in the stone at the door
of the synagogue in Worms is to be seen, as due to
this constant sacred rubbing.<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c012'><sup>[418]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>6. TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN AMERICA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the West, as in the East, traces of the primitive
sacredness of the threshold and the doorway are to be
found. The stepped pyramid, or uplifted threshold,
with the sanctuary at its summit, was the earliest form
of temple or place of worship in Mexico, and in Central
and South America. In the later and more elaborate
temples there was no altar within the building,
although an image of the god was there.</p>

<p class='c000'>The altar, or stone of sacrifice, was without, before
the door of the sanctuary.<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a> When a sacrifice was
offered on the altar, the blood of that sacrifice was
smeared on the doors of the temple of the god.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c012'><sup>[420]</sup></a>
Human sacrifices were included in these offerings,
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>in earlier times.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Even when larger temples were
erected, and altars were enclosed within them, human
victims were brought to the temple entrance into
the hands of the priests; and from the threshold they
were borne by the priests themselves, to be laid on
the altar.<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Pipiles, a Maya people, in Central
America, there were “two principal and very solemn
sacrifices; one at the commencement of summer, and
the other at the beginning of winter.” Little boys,
from six to twelve years old, were the victims of sacrifice.
At the sound of trumpets and drums, which
assembled the people, four priests came out of the
temple with braziers of coals on which incense was
burning, and after various ceremonies and religious
exercises they proceeded to the house of the high-priest,
near the temple, and took from it the boy victim
of the sacrifice. He was then conducted four
times round the court of the temple, with dancing
and singing.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this ceremony was finished, the high-priest
came out of his house with the second priest and his
major-domo, and they proceeded to the temple steps,
accompanied by the principal men of the locality,
who, however, stopped at the threshold of the temple.
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>Then and there the four priests “seized the victim by
his extremities, and the major-domo coming out, with
little bells on his wrists and ankles, opened the left
breast of the boy, tore out his heart, and handed it to
the high-priest, who put it into a little embroidered
purse, which he closed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The blood of the victim was received by the priests
in a vessel made of a gourd, and was by them sprinkled
in the direction of the four cardinal points. Then the
heart, in its purse, was put back into the body of the
victim, and the body itself was interred inside of
the temple. This sacrifice, at the threshold altar, was
performed at the threshold, or the beginning, of each
of the two chief seasons of the year.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the temples of Central America, generally, the
doorway was hardly less prominent than in the temples
of Egypt. There were massive decorations on and
above the lintels; the door jams were richly sculptured;
and there were male and female figures, or
figures of animals, as guardians on either side of the
entrance. In some instances a winged globe was
above the door; and the uplifted hand was found over
the doorway or at the sides.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>Among the Natchez Indians, along the lower Mississippi,
there was an annual “Harvest Festival,” or
“Festival of New Fire,” which was celebrated with
great ceremony. An altar was in front of the temple,
just before the door. On this occasion the priest
of the sun stood on the threshold of the temple in
the early morning, watching for the first rays of the
rising sun. The chiefs, and braves old and young,
stood near the altar. The women with infants in
their arms stood in a semicircle facing the priest.
When he gave the signal of his recognition of the
sun, by rubbing two pieces of wood to start a new fire
for the altar, they faced about to the east and held up
their infants to the sun. Other exercises of worship
followed. The priest’s place in this ceremony was on
the threshold, before the altar of that temple.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c012'><sup>[425]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In America, as in the other continents, there are
survivals of the primal sacredness of the threshold of
a place of public worship, in the formal ceremonies
attending the laying of the corner-stone, or threshold-stone,
of a new church building of any denomination;
and in the use of holy water at the doorway on entering
Roman Catholic churches. More or less importance
is attached in Protestant Episcopal churches to
the location of the baptismal font near the door, and
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>to the beginning of the marriage service before the
bridal party approaches the threshold of the sanctuary
proper.</p>

<p class='c000'>If indeed, there be found no trace of the fountain of
life flowing from under the threshold sanctuary of the
gods worshiped by the aborigines of America, such a
fountain was searched for in this land by Ponce de
Leon and his followers.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>7.  TEMPLE THRESHOLDS IN ISLANDS OF THE SEA.</h3>

<p class='c011'>There is a certain resemblance in the plan of some
of the temples of the South Sea Islands to those of
Central America. A stepped pyramid in a large court
was the central shrine; “in front of which the images
were kept, and the altars fixed.”<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c012'><sup>[426]</sup></a> In both cases the
altars were outside of the shrine,–at its threshold, as it
were. A method of sacrificing was by bleeding a pig
to death before the altar, “washing the carcass with
the blood, and then placing it in a crouching position
on the altar.”<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c012'><sup>[427]</sup></a> An uplifted hand was one of the symbols
on these stepped pyramid shrines.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c012'><sup>[428]</sup></a> The temple
foundation, or the threshold of the sacred building,
was formerly laid in human blood.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c012'><sup>[429]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A recognition of the threshold, in a sacred service,
and in a form of covenanting, is found in the ceremonies
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>of circumcision as observed in Madagascar.
This rite is not at infancy, as among the Jews, but is
at the threshold of young manhood. Its period is
fixed by the king, who, on “an application from the
parents or the friends of any number of children in a
given province, appoints a time, and orders the observance
of the rite.” He is the “high-priest on this
occasion.” The rite marks the transition of the boy
from his dependence on his parents to his personal service
of the king, as a member of the community.</p>

<p class='c000'>Holy water is brought from a distance to the house
of the master of ceremonies, as the sanctuary for the
occasion. A sheep is killed immediately before this
house, and the boys are caused to step across its
blood. This sacrifice is called “fahazza,” or “causing
fruitfulness,” and it is supposed to be the means of
causing fruitfulness in all the women who obtain a
share of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tree is planted at the northeast corner of the
house, and a lamp is fixed on it. Honey and water
are poured upon the tree, and the boys partake of this
mixture. The next day the persons present walk
three times round the house, with various ceremonies,
and then stop at the doorway. The rite of circumcision
is performed on each boy as he sits on a drum
at “the threshold of the door,” held firmly by several
men. The knife with which it is performed is previously
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>dipped in the blood of a young bullock, an
ear of which is slit by the operator. A covenant of
fealty to the king is entered into by the youth on this
occasion. Sacrifices and feasting follow this ceremony.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c012'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>One of the ancient gods of Maui, an island of
Hawaii, was Keoroeva. “In all the temples dedicated
to its worship, the image was placed within the inner
apartment, on the left-hand side of the door; and immediately
before it stood the altar, on which the offerings
of every kind were usually placed.”<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c012'><sup>[431]</sup></a> The altar
was at the doorway, in this case, as so generally elsewhere.
Tiha was a female idol, as Keoroeva was a
male, and much “the same homage and offerings”
were given to her as to him.<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c012'><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Kohala, one of the large divisions of Hawaii,
stood a prominent temple called Bukohōla, built by
King Kamehameha, at the time of his conquest of the
Sandwich Islands. “At the south end of this great
edifice was a kind of inner court, which might be
called the <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></em> of the temple, where the
principal idol used to stand, surrounded by a number
of images of inferior deities.” “On the outside, near
the entrance to the inner court [at the threshold of the
<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span></em>] was the place of the <em>rere</em> [or <em>lélé</em>]
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>(altar), on which human and other sacrifices were
offered.”<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c012'><sup>[433]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Human victims were ordinarily slain in sacrifice
outside of the sanctuary proper, and then their bodies,
carefully preserved whole, were taken within to be
presented to the idol.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c012'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There were Hawaiian cities of refuge, or <em>puhonuas</em>,
as sanctuaries for guilty fugitives. A thief, or a murderer,
might be pursued to the very gateway of one
of those cities, but as soon as he crossed the threshold
of that gate, even though the gate were open, and no
barrier hindered pursuit, he was safe, as at the city
altar. When once within the sacred city, the fugitive’s
first duty was to present himself before the idol,
and return thanks for his protection.<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a> This was substantially
the Hebrew law as to the cities of refuge.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c012'><sup>[436]</sup></a>
Safety was only within the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are traces of the primitive idea of a spring of
life-giving waters flowing from under the threshold of
the goddess of life, in the Islands of the Sea. According
to the myths of that region, Vari, or “The-very-beginning”
of life was a woman. She plucked off a
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>piece of her right side and it became a man, or part
man and part fish, known as Vātea, or Avatea. From
the under-world there came to Vātea a supernatural
woman called Papa, or Foundation. From this union
the human race began. Rongo was the first-born son.
The Hades of Polynesia is Avaika, or Hawaika. In
the days of Rongo, and later, there was an opening
from earth to Avaika; but because of the misdoings
of the denizens of that realm, coming up through that
passage-way, Tiki, a lovely woman, a descendant of
Rongo, “rolled herself alive down into the gloomy
opening, which immediately closed upon her.” She
was the first to die. And now “Tiki sits at the threshold”
of her home below, to welcome the descendants
of Rongo, who bring her an offering. A sacred
stream of water, “Vairorongo,” comes up from below
into the sacred grove devoted to the worship of
Rongo, and near that stream it is possible for a spirit
to be returned to life and to a home on earth again.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious that the idea of the sacredness of the
threshold, in home, in temple, or in sanctuary, is not
of any one time or of any one people, but is of human
nature as human nature everywhere. It shows itself
all the world over, and always. And it has to do with
life, and its perpetuation or reproduction.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>8. ONLY ONE FOUNDATION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>An idea tangent to, rather than identical with, the
thought of the altar sacredness of the temple threshold,
as found among primitive peoples, is that the first
temple foundation is the foundation for all subsequent
temple building at that place. And it has already
been shown that the threshold, or hearthstone, or
corner-stone, is considered the foundation.<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In ancient Babylonia a temple, however grand and
extensive, was supposed to be built on the foundation
of an earlier temple; the one threshold being
the first threshold and the latest. If, indeed, there
was a variation from the original foundation in the
construction of a new temple, there was confusion and
imperfectness in consequence, and the only hope of
reformation was in finding the first temple threshold
and rebuilding on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is an illustration of this in an inscription discovered
in the foundation of a temple at “Ur of the
Chaldees.”<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a> Nabonidus (556–538 B.C.), the last Babylonian
king, tells with interest of his search for the
old foundation, or outline plan, of the ancient temple,
Eulbar, or, more properly, Eulmash, of the goddess
Istar of Agade, as follows:<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>The foundation of Eulmash in Agade had not been
found from Sargon, king of Babylon (3800 B.C.), and
Narâm-Sin, his son, kings living formerly, until the
government of Nabunaʾid king of Babylon.</p>

<p class='c000'>King Kurigalzu (II.), about 1300 B.C., had, in his
reign, searched for this foundation, but had failed to
find it, and he had left this record: “The foundation
of Eulmash I sought, but did not find it.” Later on,
Esarhaddon, king of Assyria and Babylonia (681–669
B.C.), searched for it, but without success. Again,
Nebuchadrezzar (605–561 B.C.) mobilized his large
armies, and ordered them to search for the foundation
stone, or threshold, but all his efforts were in vain.
Finally Nabunaʾid, the last king of Babylon before its
fall under Cyrus, gathered his many soldiers, and
ordered them to search for the foundation stone. For
“three years in the tracks of Nebuchadrezzar king
of Babylon,” says Nabunaʾid, “I sought right and
left, before and behind, but did not find it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Encouraged by a prompting from the moon-god
Sin, Nabunaʾid tried at another time and in another
place, and this time with success. He found the inscription
of King Shagarakti-Buriash (1350 B.C.),
which tells that he had laid a new foundation exactly
upon the old one of King Zabû (about 2300 B.C.).
Then Nabunaʾid made sure to preserve the exact outline
of the old shrine. He laid the foundation, and
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>restored the ancient temple, so that “it did not deviate
an inch to the outside or the inside.”<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There are indications of the same high value set
upon the primal foundation of a temple in the records
of ancient Egypt. A temple at its highest grandeur
is in the location of a prehistoric sanctuary. “The
site on which it is built is generally <em>holy ground</em>,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a> that
is, a spot on which since the memory of man an older
sanctuary of the god had stood. Even those Egyptian
temples which seem most modern have usually a
long history,–the edifice may have seemed very insignificant,
but as the prestige of the god increased
larger buildings were erected, which again, in the
course of centuries, were enlarged and rebuilt in such
a way that the original plan could no longer be traced.
This is the history of nearly all Egyptian temples, and
explains the fact that we know so little of the temples
of the Old and of the Middle Empire; they have all
been metamorphosed into the vast buildings of the
New Empire.”<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>While early Vedic and Brahmanic religion makes
no mention of temples as such, fire from an ancestral
altar was borne to a newly erected altar, in order to
secure a continuance of the sacred influences issuing
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>from that original family threshold.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a> And Vishnooism
takes old temples from Booddhism for its centers
of worship, prizing the old sacred foundation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Buddha-Gaya,” or “Bodhi-Gaya,” in Upper India,
is famous as the locality of the holy pipal tree, or the
Booddha-drum (“Tree of Knowledge”), under which
for six years sat Sakya Sinha, in meditation, before he
attained to Booddha-hood. A temple still standing on
that site is supposed to have been rebuilt A.D. 1306,
on the remains of one visited by Hwen Thsang, a
Chinese traveler, in the seventh century of our era,
which, in turn, had been built by Amara Sinha, or
Amara Deva, about A.D. 500. This earlier temple is
said to have been built by a command of Booddha
himself conveyed in a vision, or by a command of the
Brahmanical Mahâdeva, on the site of a still earlier
sanctuary, or monastery, erected by Asoka between
259 and 241 B.C., on the site of Booddha’s meditations,
about 300 B.C.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a> The existing temple has been
called at different times “Buddha-pad” and “Vishnu-pad,”
“Booddha’s foot” and “Vishnoo’s foot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Kuru-Kshetra, or the “Plain of Kuru,” near Delhi,
India, has been deemed holy ground from time immemorial.
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>At Thâvesar, on this plain, a temple of Siva
was built on a site that was sacred long before Sivaism
was known. It is even believed that the sacredness
of this site runs back to the ancient times of the
Rig Veda. The boundaries of this “Holy Land” are
given in the great Hindoo epic, the Mahabharata.
This plain is said to comprise three hundred and
sixty holy shrines, each of which is erected on a foundation
sacred from the times of the gods themselves.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c012'><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>So general, in India, is this habit of building a sanctuary
on an old sacred foundation, that it is said that
“the erection of a mosk by a Muhammadan conqueror
always implies the previous destruction of a Hindu
temple.”<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c012'><sup>[447]</sup></a> Thus a mosk erected by the emperor
Altamash, A D. 1232, is supposed to have been on the
foundation of a temple of the sun, built for Raja
Pasupati about A.D. 300.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c012'><sup>[448]</sup></a> Not a new foundation,
but an old one, was sought, in India, for a new temple,
even to a god newly worshiped there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourteen centuries before Christ, Pan-Kăng, an emperor
of China, moved his capital from north of the
Ho to south of it because he had ascertained that the
original foundation was attempted to be laid there by
his ancestor Thang in the Shing dynasty, seventeen
reigns before him; hence the removal back to that
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>first foundation would renew the blessing of Thang
upon his descendants.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c012'><sup>[449]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A temple has added sacredness in China according
as its foundation is on a spot originally chosen or
honored by a representative of Heaven as a threshold
of a place of worship. Thus Tai Shan, or the “Great
Mount,” in the province of Shantung, China, is mentioned
in the Shoo King, or Book of Records, as the
site of the great Emperor Shun’s altar of sacrifice to
Heaven, 2254 B.C., or, say, three centuries before the
time of Abraham. On this holy mountain, as the
earliest historic foundation of Chinese worship, “is
the great rendezvous of devotees, every sect has there
its temples and idols, scattered up and down its
sides;” and great multitudes come thither to worship
from near and far.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>This idea shows itself in modern discoveries among
the ruins of ancient Greece. It appears that when
Pericles (437 B.C.) began his building of the new
Propylæa on the Acropolis, he would have cleared
away the remains of such ancient sacred structures as
stood within its outline. “The plan of Mnesikles the
architect was very simple, and is still clear enough,
though it was never fully carried out.” “That the
original plan of Mnesikles had undergone modifications
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>was long ago seen by every architect who made
the Propylæa matter of serious study.” Dr. Dörpfeld
thinks he has discovered how the plan was modified,
and why. The enforced departure from the original
plan seems to have been because that plan involved
the destruction of shrines on an earlier foundation,
with a threshold that might not be moved. The gate
of Cimon, with its “statue of some guardian god of
the gate,–it may be Hermes Propylaios himself,”–was
within that outline, and also other sacred sites.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Against such intrusion it is very likely the priesthood
rose and protested, and, before even the foundations
were laid, he had to give up, at least for the
time, the whole of the southeast hall, and a part of
the southwest wing.” This conclusion is the result
of recent investigation by careful scholars, and it is in
accordance with the ascertained fact that in primitive
thought an original foundation for a temple or shrine
is counted sacred for all time as the foundation there
for such a place of worship, not to be swept away or
ignored in any rebuilding or new building.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When from any reason, in early Europe, an ancient
shrine must be removed from its primitive foundation,
it was deemed desirable to remove to the new site a
portion of the foundation itself, as well as the sanctuary
or altar above that foundation. Thus, for example,
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>when Thorolf of Norway, who had charge of
the temple of Thor in Mostur, removed to Iceland in
A.D. 833, he took with him the temple posts and
furniture “and the very earth on which the altar of
that idol had been erected.” And when he landed in
Iceland, Thorolf built a new temple of Thor, with an
altar on the foundation which he had brought from
the earlier shrine. A thousand years after this the
foundation-site of that second temple was still pointed
out near Hofstad, in Iceland.<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Bible language and narrative abound with incidental
evidence of the commonness of this primitive idea.
When Jacob, on his way to Haran, came to Beth-el–a
House of God–he lighted on “the place” (<em>hammaqâm</em>)
where,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a> long before, his ancestor Abraham had
worshiped, as he came from Egypt by way of the
Negeb.<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c012'><sup>[454]</sup></a> And yet earlier Abraham himself, as he
came a pilgrim from Haran and Ur, had there
“builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon
the name of the Lord.”<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c012'><sup>[455]</sup></a> And if that place were
already known as Beth-el it must have been a sanctuary
before Abraham’s day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, is told that the
ground whereon he stands is “holy ground,” and that
he is to bring the Hebrews out of Egypt to worship
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>God in that mountain.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c012'><sup>[456]</sup></a> And the Egyptian records
give reason for supposing that that region of Mt.
Sinai, perhaps of the moon-god “Sin,” was known as
holy ground, and as the “land of God,” or of the
gods, before the days of Moses.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c012'><sup>[457]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At Jerusalem the Temple was built on Mt. Moriah,
where the ark of the covenant rested after its
return from Philistia,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c012'><sup>[458]</sup></a> and where David erected an altar
to the Lord after the staying of the pestilence from
Israel.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c012'><sup>[459]</sup></a> And it is supposed that this same Mt. Moriah
was where Abraham offered a sacrifice to God
on an altar he had built for the sacrifice of his son.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c012'><sup>[460]</sup></a>
And this site of the Temple at Jerusalem is held sacred
to-day, in view of its being deemed by multitudes
a holy place from the beginning of the world.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c012'><sup>[461]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When Naaman the Syrian was healed of leprosy by
Elisha, the prophet of Israel, he desired thenceforth
to worship Jehovah in his Syrian home. To this end
he asked of Elisha the gift of “two mules’ burden of
earth” from Samaria, in order that he might on that
sacred foundation erect in Syria an altar to Jehovah.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c012'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In a prophecy of the Messiah as the foundation, or
threshold, of a new temple, it was declared by the
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>Lord: “Behold, I lay [or, I have laid] in Zion for a
foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-stone
of sure foundation.”<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c012'><sup>[463]</sup></a> Again, it was the promise
of God to the Israelites that they should be restorers
of worship on former foundations. “They that shall
be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt
raise up the foundations of many generations; and
thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The
restorer of paths to dwell in.”<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>New Testament phraseology makes frequent reference
to this same idea. “According to the grace
which was given unto me, as a wise master-builder, I
laid a foundation,” says Paul. “But let each man
take heed how he buildeth thereon. For other foundation
can no man lay than that is laid, which is
Christ Jesus.”<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a> The Christian saints of the “household
of God,” as “living stones,”<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a> are “built upon
the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ
Jesus himself being the chief corner stone; in whom
each several building, fitly framed together, groweth
into a holy temple in the Lord.”<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Muhammadanism, which shows many survivals of
primitive ideas and primitive customs, emphasizes the
importance of the first foundation as the only foundation,
in the traditions and legends of the holy places
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>of its most sacred city. Every <em>masjid</em>, or “place of
prostration,” in that vicinity is on a site counted holy
long centuries before the days of the Prophet of Islam.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Kaʿbah, or Holy House, in the mosk at Meccah
is said to have been built by Adam himself, on
the model of a similar structure in heaven. It would
seem as if no earthly foundation, or threshold, could
have been earlier than that; indeed, the Qurân declares:
“The first house appointed unto men to worship
in was that which was in Beccah [or Meccah];”<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a>
yet there is a tradition that Adam erected a place of
prayer even before he built the Kaʿbah. In the Deluge
the Holy House was destroyed; but Abraham was
directed to rebuild it, and on digging beneath the surface
of its site he discovered the original foundation,
and the Kaʿbah was newly built up on that.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to Muhammadan traditions, it was while
Hagar was near the site of the Holy House, with her
famishing son Ishmael, that a spring of water gushed
forth with its life-giving stream from beneath that
holy site. And that spring is the well Zemzem, or
Zamzam, whose waters are deemed sacred and life-giving
to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mount Arafat, a holy hill near Meccah, is another
place of pilgrimage, and its sacredness dates from even
an earlier day than the laying of the first foundation
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>of the Holy House at Meccah by Adam. When our
first parents were cast out of their heavenly paradise,
Adam lighted in Ceylon, and Eve in Arabia. Seeking
each other, they met on Mount Arafat, or the Mount
of Recognition, and therefore that spot of their reunion
and new covenanting is a place of pilgrimage
and worship for the faithful of all the world at this
time.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a> Adam is said to have built a <em>madaa</em>, a place of
prayer, on Mount Arafat, before he built the Kaʿbah.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a>
The religion of Islam thus teaches its subjects to worship
at the earliest threshold laid by our first parents
in their primal covenanting, and all other religions
recognize the importance of a similar idea.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>III. <br /> SACRED BOUNDARY LINE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1.  FROM TEMPLE TO DOMAIN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Man’s first dwelling-place was the cave, or the tent,
or the hut, in which he made a home with his family.
The threshold and hearth of that dwelling-place was
the boundary of his earthly possessions. It was the
sacred border or limit of the portion of the earth’s surface
over which he claimed control, and where he and
his were under the special protection of the deity with
whom he was in covenant. Therefore the threshold
hearth was hallowed as a place of covenant worship.</p>

<p class='c000'>As families were formed into tribes and communities,
they came to have a common ruler or priest, and
his dwelling-place was counted by all as the common
center of covenant with their common deity; and
when they would worship that deity there, they worshiped
at the threshold altar of his sanctuary. So it
was that the threshold was the place of the hearth-fire
and altar, in both house and temple.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>When man acquired property rights beyond his
dwelling-place, and communities and peoples gained
control over portions of country more or less extensive,
the boundary limits of their possessions were
extended, but were no less real and positive than
before. The protecting deity of the region thus
bounded was recognized as having sway in that domain;
and those who were dwellers there were in
covenant relations with him. Therefore it was that
the boundary line of such domain was deemed its
threshold, and as such was held sacred as a place
of worship and of sacrifice.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2.  LOCAL LANDMARKS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A private landmark was a sacred boundary, and
was a threshold altar for its possessor. To remove
or to disregard such a local threshold, was an offense
not only against its owner, but against the deity in
whose name it had been set up.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earliest remains from unearthed Babylonia
are local landmarks, or threshold boundary
stones, inscribed, severally, with a dedication and an
appeal to the deity honored by him who erected the
stone. These local landmarks were ordinarily in the
form of a phallus; as phallic forms were numerous
under Babylonian temple thresholds. Among the
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>records of those peoples are writings, showing the
importance attached to such threshold stones, in
the contracts accompanying their setting up, and in
the sacred ceremonies on that occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Illustrations of the importance attached by the
ancient Babylonians to a boundary stone, or threshold
landmark, are found in the records of the imprecations
inscribed on these phallic pillars, as directed
against the violator of their sacredness.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c012'><sup>[471]</sup></a> For example,
a Babylonian, Sir-usur [“O snake-god protect”], a
descendant of the house of Habban, presented a valuable
tract of land to his daughter on her betrothal to
Tâbashâp-Marduk. The withering curse inscribed on
the conventional boundary-stone pillar is as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“For all future time: Whosoever, of the brothers,
sons, family, relatives, descendants, servants purchased
or house-born, of the house of Habban, be he a prefect,
or an overseer, or anybody else, shall rise and stand
up to take this field away, or to remove this boundary
stone, and causes this field to be presented to a god,
or sends some one to take it away [for the state],
or brings it into his own possession; who changes the
area, the limit, or the boundary stone, divides it into
pieces, or takes a piece from it, saying, ‘The field
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>and <em>mulugi</em><a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c012'><sup>[472]</sup></a> have not been presented;’ or who on
account of the dire curse [written] on this boundary
stone, sends a fool, a deaf man, a blind man, a reckless
man, an enemy, an alien, an ignorant man, and causes
this inscribed stone to be removed, throws it into the
water, hides it in the earth, crushes it with a stone,
burns it with fire, effaces it and writes something else
on it, or puts it into a place where nobody can see it,–upon
this man may the great gods Anu, Bêl, Ea,
and Nusku, look wrathfully, uproot his foundation,
and destroy his offspring. May Marduk, the great
lord, cause him to carry dropsy as an ever-entangling
net; may Shamash the judge, greatest of heaven and
earth, decide all his lawsuits, standing relentlessly
against him; may Sin, the light dwelling in the brilliant
heavens, cover him with leprosy as a garment;
like a wild ass may he lie down at the wall surrounding
his city; may Ishtar, mistress of heaven and earth,
lead him into evil daily before the god and the king;
may Ninib, born in the temple Ekura, the sublime
son of Bêl, uproot his area, his limit, and his boundary
stone; may Gula, the great physician, consort of
the god Ninib, put never-ceasing poison into his body
till he urinates blood and pus like water; may Rammân,
first of heaven and earth, the strong son of the
god Anu, inundate his field, and destroy the corn,
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>that thorns may shoot up, and may his feet tread
down vegetation and pasturage; may Nabû, the sublime
messenger, bring want and famine upon him,
and whatsoever he desires for the hole of his mouth
may he not obtain; and may the great gods, as many
names as are mentioned on this inscribed stone, curse
him with a dire curse that cannot be removed, and
destroy his seed for ever and ever.”<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c012'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Prominence is given, in the ancient laws of India, to
the manner in which disputed boundaries between
villages, and between land owners, shall be settled;
and it is made evident that a peculiar sacredness
attaches to these landmarks. The king was to decide
the dispute, after hearing testimony and examining
evidence. Trees, and mounds, or heaps of earth,
were preferred as landmarks; and tanks, wells, cisterns,
and fountains, as also temples, were desired on
boundary lines.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c012'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Emphasis was laid on the sacredness of the local
landmark, in the laws of the Hebrews; and a curse
was pronounced against him who dared remove this
threshold altar. “Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor’s
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>landmark, which they of old time have set, in
thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit, in the land
that the Lord thy God giveth thee,” was an injunction
in the fundamental law of the Promised Land.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c012'><sup>[475]</sup></a>
And it passed into a proverb of duty: “Remove not
the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.”<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c012'><sup>[476]</sup></a>
It was a reproach to a people that there were those
among them who would “remove the landmarks”
and disregard sacred property rights.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c012'><sup>[477]</sup></a> And among
the curses which were to be spoken from the summit
of Ebal, when Israel took possession of Canaan,
was this: “Cursed be he that removeth his neighbor’s
landmark. And,” it was added, “all the people shall
say, Amen.”<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c012'><sup>[478]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Abraham and Abimelech found that their followers
were quarreling over the boundary line between their
respective domains on the borders of the Negeb.
Abraham claimed the well at Beer-sheba as his by
right, but the servants of Abimelech forcibly took possession
of it. So the two chieftains met and agreed
upon a border line, and made a covenant with accompanying
sacrifices. “And Abraham planted a
tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba” as his border landmark,
“and called there on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting
God.”<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c012'><sup>[479]</sup></a> Border landmarks were in the form
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>of a pillar, a tree, a heap, or a stele, in Oriental countries
generally.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Jacob and Laban agreed to part in peace
after their stormy meeting in Gilead, they set up a
heap of stones and a stone pillar as a monument of
witness of their mutual covenant, and as a landmark
of their agreed territorial boundary. This memorial
of their covenant was called “Galeed,” or “Witness
Heap,” and “Mizpah,” or “Watch Tower.” “And
Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the
pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee. This
heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not
pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. The
God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God [or,
gods] of their father, judge betwixt us.”<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c012'><sup>[480]</sup></a> The new
boundary mark was a token of a sacred covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>In classic literature and customs the sacred boundary
landmark is prominent as devoted to, or as representing,
various deities, at different times. Zeus and
Hermes among the Greeks; Jupiter, Mercury, Silvanus,
and Terminus, among the Romans, are sometimes
interchangeably referred to in this connection.
The legends and symbols employed seem to indicate
that life and its transmission took their start at the
threshold boundary, and therefore a pillar or a phallus
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>marked every new beginning along a road or at a
territorial boundary.</p>

<p class='c000'>An image of Zeus, or Jupiter, was sometimes employed
as a boundary landmark, and an image of
Hermes, or Mercury, was at the starting-point of a
road, and again at various points along the road.
Zeus, or Jupiter, was chief of gods as the arbiter of
life. Hermes, or Mercury, was earliest known as the
fertilizing god of earth, and hence was the promoter
of all forms of life, as guardian of flocks, fish, fields,
and fruits. He also guarded those who went out
from the threshold. Sacrifices were offered to him by
Athenian generals as they started on their expeditions.
He was even spoken of as the inventor of sacrifices
and the promoter of commerce and of enrichment.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c012'><sup>[481]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Of Terminus, Ovid say: “When the night shall
have passed away [and the threshold of a new day is
to be crossed], let the god who by his landmark
divides the fields be worshiped with the accustomed
honors. Terminus,<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c012'><sup>[482]</sup></a> whether thou art a stone, or
whether a stock sunk deep in the field by the ancients,
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>yet even in this form thou dost possess divinity.”<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c012'><sup>[483]</sup></a>
This symbol of Terminus was regularly “sprinkled
with the blood of a slain lamb,” in recognition of its
sacredness.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said that Numa, the second king of Rome, who
was revered by the Romans as the author of their
whole system of religious worship, directed that every
one should mark the boundaries of his landed property
by stones consecrated to Jupiter, and that yearly sacrifices
should be offered at these boundary stones, at
the festival of the Terminalia.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c012'><sup>[484]</sup></a> At this festival the
two owners of adjacent property crowned the statue
or stone pillar with garlands, and raised a rude altar,
on which they offered up corn, honeycombs, and
wine, and sacrificed a lamb or a sucking pig, with
accompanying praises to the god.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c012'><sup>[485]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Silvanus also was a god of the boundary. He was
represented by a tree grove, as Terminus was by a
pillar, and offerings of fruit, grain, and milk, and of
pigs, were made to him. When he would be guarded
against as a source of evil in a home, the protectors
of the inmates would perform certain ceremonies at
the threshold of the house.</p>

<p class='c000'>A tree, and sometimes a grove, was the sacred landmark
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>of a village boundary in primitive lands. Such
trees and groves are still to be found in Equatorial
Africa. Describing some of these in Zinga and its
vicinity, Stanley expresses surprise that they have so
long remained untouched in “a country left to the
haphazard care of patriarchal chiefs ignorant of written
laws.”<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c012'><sup>[486]</sup></a> But reverence for a threshold landmark
seems to be in the very nature of a primitive people,
as truly as any primitive sentiment; and sentiment is
in itself a dominant law.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the boundary line between two villages in Samoa,
in olden time, there were two stones said to have
been two living beings. When any quarrel arose,
those engaged in it were told, “Go and settle it at the
stones;” and they went to those boundary line stones
and fought out their contest.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c012'><sup>[487]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Trees and stone pillars are still known as boundary
landmarks between parishes and townships in Europe
and America, as in Asia, Africa, and Polynesia in more
primitive days; and their importance is recognized as
peculiar, even if not always absolutely sacred. The
annual custom of “beating the bounds” of a parish
by the parish authorities survives in some parts of
England to-day. A procession makes the circuit of
the parish boundary, under the care of a “select
vestryman,” or other parish official, halting at every
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>landmark to identify it and carefully to observe its
location.</p>

<p class='c000'>In former times it was customary to take the boys
of the parish on this round, and beat them at every
landmark, in order to impress upon their memories its
precise position. More recently the boys are permitted
to carry willow wands peeled white, and with
these to beat the landmarks. The later plan is certainly
more satisfactory to the boys, and it is quite as
likely to impress their memories. Formerly this ceremony
was accompanied by religious services, in which
the clergyman invoked curses on him who “transgresseth
the bounds and doles of his neighbor,” and
blessings on him who regarded the landmarks.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c012'><sup>[488]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It has been suggested that this fixing and honoring
of the landmarks by an annual festival goes back to
the Roman Terminalia, in the days of Numa, but
there is reason to believe that it was far earlier than
that. There are traces of it in primitive times, among
various primitive peoples.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Russia, the Cossacks long had a custom somewhat
like this, in the case of a disputed boundary
line. When the boundary had been formally determined,
all the boys of the two contiguous stanitsas, or
land divisions, were collected, and driven by the people
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>along the frontier line. “At each landmark a number
of boys were soundly whipped and allowed to run
home,” in order that in later years they might be able
to testify as to the spot where that landmark stood.
In cases where the boys’ memory failed to be accurate,
an arbiter was chosen from the older inhabitants, and
sworn to act honestly to the best of his knowledge;
and his decision was accepted as final.<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c012'><sup>[489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A similar custom of beating the bounds under a
“selectman” of the town has existed in portions of
New England until recently, and perhaps it has not
yet died out there. Thus Ralph Waldo Emerson
speaks of the selectmen of Concord perambulating
the bounds of its township “once in five years,” up to
1858.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c012'><sup>[490]</sup></a> Is there not a survival of this old custom in
the habit of striking a child on his birthday as many
blows as he has passed years, when he comes to the
threshold of another year of his life?</p>

<p class='c000'>Mile-posts would seem to have been originally
landmarks separating the public way from private
lands, being placed at regular distances along the road
for convenience of measurement and locating. They
marked the threshold of the “king’s highway” to and
from his capital in the Roman empire, as trees marked
the border-lines of the principal roads in Greece.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. NATIONAL BORDERS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Stone pillars marking the exact boundaries of states
or nations, whether settled by a joint commission or
by a conqueror’s fiat, are not a modern invention,
although they are in use to-day. They are of old
time, and of primitive ages. And these boundaries
of a country are by their very nature its thresholds.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Babylonia, the name of Nebuchadrezzar meant
literally, “Nebo protect the boundary!” The threshold
of the empire was sacred; and the deity, with
whom the Babylonian king was in covenant, was the
protector of that boundary, and of those who dwelt
within it. From the earliest times onward an Oriental
sovereign would set up a pillar, or pillars, or
stele, at the extreme limits of his newly extended
dominion, as the outer threshold or doorway of his
empire.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Tiglath-Pileser I. to Esarhaddon, from about
1100 B.C. to 669 B.C., the great Assyrian kings tell
us, in their inscriptions, that whenever they restored
an old boundary of their predecessors that had been
lost to them, or extended their boundary beyond its
former limits, they had set up a large stele bearing their
image at this threshold of their empire.<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c012'><sup>[491]</sup></a> Frequently
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>these stele doorways,<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c012'><sup>[492]</sup></a> with the king represented on
the threshold, had inscriptions on them giving the
story of the new conquests, with an ascription of
honor to the covenant god by whose power they had
been wrought. Prominent mountain peaks, sources
of rivers, the temples or market-places of conquered
cities, the banks of lakes, or the shores of the sea, are
chosen as conspicuous places for such steles. National
boundary marks of this character are still to be
seen on the rocks of Nahr-el-Kelb, above Beyroot, on
the shores of the Mediterranean, and at the sources of
the Tigris and the Euphrates.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c012'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Ashurnâsirapli (king of Assyria, 885–860 B.C.) tells
of such a new boundary mark set up by him at the
farthest point of his conquests, “whither nobody of
my royal ancestors had advanced.... At that time
I made a picture [a stele] of my person. The glory
of my power I wrote upon it. On the mountain Eki,
in the city Ashurnâsirapli [named after the king], at a
spring I set it up.”<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c012'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A similar custom would seem to have prevailed
with the rulers of ancient Egypt. Sneferu, a king of
the fourth dynasty, greatest among the very early
names of the Old Empire (say, about 4000 B.C.), went
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>down as a conqueror into the Peninsula of Sinai, and
left there inscribed a mammoth figure of himself, on
the granite hills above the famous copper and turquoise
mines of Wady Magharah. He is styled in
the accompanying inscription the “vanquisher of a
foreign people.”<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c012'><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As early as the twelfth dynasty of ancient Egypt,
before the days of Abraham, stone thresholds marked
the upper border of that mighty empire. “Two huge
pillars of stone, covered with long inscriptions, served
formerly as boundary marks between the Egyptian
empire and the negro-land called Heh.”<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c012'><sup>[496]</sup></a> King Usurtasen
III., who set up these landmarks, says in an
inscription on the second of them: “Every one of my
sons who maintains this boundary which I have fixed,
he shall be called my son who was born of me. My
son is like the protector of his father (that is Horus),
like the preserver of the boundary of his father (that
is Osiris.) But if he abandons it, so that he does not
fight upon it, he is not my son, he is not then born
of me. I have caused my own image to be set up,
on this boundary which I have fixed, not that ye
may (only) worship it (the image of the founder), but
that ye may fight upon it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>On the oldest map in the world, a map of the gold
districts in Nubia, in the nineteenth dynasty of Egypt,
there is a mention of the “memorial stone of King
Mineptah I. Seti I.” And that memorial stone, of
this new threshold of domain, marked the boundary
line of empire in that direction.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c012'><sup>[497]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Rameses II. had it recorded on the walls of the
rock grotto of Bayt-el-Walli concerning his threshold
extensions: “The deeds of victory are inscribed a
hundred thousand times on the glorious Persea. As
the chastiser of the foreigners, <em>who has placed his
boundary-marks according to his pleasure</em> in the land
of the Ruthennu, he is in truth the son of Ra, and his
very image.”<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c012'><sup>[498]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On the eastern border of Lower Egypt, the main
passage way from the Delta into Arabia, the great
gateway of the empire toward the north and the east,
is still known as <em>El Gisr</em>, or “The Threshold.”<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c012'><sup>[499]</sup></a>
This point is near Lake Timsah, on the line of the
modern Suez Canal.</p>

<p class='c000'>In ancient Greece, Theseus “set up a pillar,” as a
threshold stone between Peloponnesus and Attica,–then
called Ionia,–“writing upon it an epigram in two
trimeters, bounding the land. Of these [inscriptions]
the one toward the east side said, ‘This is not Pelopennesus,
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>but Ionia,’ and that toward the west, ‘This
is Pelopennesus, not Ionia.’”<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c012'><sup>[500]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Even the term, the “Pillars of Hercules,” as the
boundaries of the Grecian empire and the then known
world, is an indication of this idea in the classic age,
as well as in the primitive mind. Calpë and Abyla
were the door-posts of the great outer passage way,
and the threshold between those pillars was founded
upon the seas, and established upon the floods.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c012'><sup>[501]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>As showing that the term “threshold” is not
applied to these boundary stones merely by accommodation,
it is sufficient to quote from Justinian in
the case. He declares specifically that “as the
threshold makes a certain boundary in a house, so
also the ancients designed that the boundary of the
empire should be its threshold; hence it is called the
‘threshold,’ as if it were a certain bound and term.”<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c012'><sup>[502]</sup></a>
Speaking of one who has been in foreign captivity,
and who desires a resumption, or a restoration, of his
civil rights, on his coming back to his country, Justinian
says that such a return “is called <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">postliminium</span></em>
[a recrossing of the threshold], because at that same
threshold the thing which he has lost is restored to
him.”<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c012'><sup>[503]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When the old Portuguese navigators started out on
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>their voyages of discovery, they were accustomed to
take with them stone pillars to set up in a prominent
place at the farthest limits of their newly claimed territory
as the national door-posts or threshold in that
direction. Such a pillar was erected at the mouth of
the Congo River, at the time of its discovery by Diego
Cão, or Cam, in 1484–85. On this account, the river
was known for a time as the “Rio de Padrão,” or
“Pillar River.”<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c012'><sup>[504]</sup></a> It might, indeed, have been called
the “River of the Threshold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This custom of setting up stone pillars as boundary
marks along the borders of countries, nations, and
states, has been continued down to the present day.
Such landmarks are still to be seen along the borders
of the great divisions of Europe, and they are on the
lines of the several states of the United States of
America. The line between the English grants in
America, originally made to the Duke of York and
to Lord Baltimore, was, after much dispute, run by
two English surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah
Dixon, in 1763–67, and marked by stone pillars at
intervals of five miles. This was generally known
as “Mason and Dixon’s line;” it separated Pennsylvania
from Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, and
was the dividing line between the free and the slave
states before the Civil War of 1861–65. One of those
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>early stone landmarks on that line is still to be seen
near Oxford, in Chester County, Pennsylvania, as an
illustration of a practice beginning in Babylonia as far
back as 4000 B.C., and continued in America down
to A.D. 1895.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c012'><sup>[505]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>European titles of rank bear traces of the importance
formerly attached to national boundary lines and
their preservation. The old German title of “markgraf,”
the “graf” or count or warden of the marches,
designated a representative or servant of the king who
was in charge of the “marches,” or “marks,” or
“border lines,” which guarded the thresholds of the
empire in different directions. It was under “Henry
the Fowler,” early in the tenth century, that this title,
as a title, first gained prominence. Afterwards it became
hereditary; “and hence have come the innumerable
margraves, marquises, and such like of modern
times.”<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c012'><sup>[506]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“Letters of marque” were letters of commission,
or permission, granted by the government to individuals,
in time of war, to pass over the boundary
mark, or national threshold, for purposes of seizure or
reprisal. And a “marquee” is primarily a tent over,
or before, the threshold of a military commander’s
tent.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. BORDER SACRIFICES.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>An altar would have no meaning unless sacrifices
were offered at it. If, therefore, the boundary threshold
of an empire were an altar for that empire, sacrifices
would surely be offered there; and the records
of history, and the customs of old times and later,
show this to have been the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sacrifices were offered at the new boundary of an
empire, by ancient Assyrian and Egyptian kings,
when they set up a pillar, or stele, at the freshly acquired
threshold in that direction. Thus, for example,
Ashurnâsirapli (king of Assyria, 885–860 B.C.), telling
of his far-reaching conquests, says that he marched
with his armies to the slopes of the Lebanon, and to
the great sea of the Westland, and that at the mountains
of Ammanus he made and set up a stele of
victory, and offered sacrifices unto his gods.<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c012'><sup>[507]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>At the Egyptian boundary line in the Sinaitic
Peninsula, there was a temple with its sacrifices to
“the sublime Hathor, queen of heaven and earth and
the dark depths below, whom the Egyptians worshiped
as the protectress of the land of Mafkat.”
There were other temples with their sacrifices at that
point.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c012'><sup>[508]</sup></a> On the southern boundary of Egypt, in the
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>gold district of Nubia, there was “the temple of Amon
in the holy mountain,” where threshold sacrifices were
offered.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c012'><sup>[509]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>One of the most ancient of Chinese classics is the
Shih King. Its age is not known, but it is certain
that it was a classic in the days of Confucius, five
centuries before the Christian era. This work contains
frequent references to sacrifices at the border
altars, or the altars of the boundary. There were
public sacrifices at the “border altar” in the beginning
of every new year; and again when a ruler
crossed his border line on a warlike mission.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c012'><sup>[510]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>When, in ancient times, a Chinese emperor passed
over the outer threshold of his empire, he offered a
sacrifice of a dog, by running over it with the wheels
of his chariot. This is supposed to have been a propitiatory
offering to the dog-shaped guardians of the
roadway threshold, known also among the Indo-Aryans
and the Assyro-Babylonians.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c012'><sup>[511]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From what is known of modern customs in this line,
and from occasional historical references to the matter,
it would seem that where there were no gateways, or
double columns to stand for door-posts, or doorway
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>stele, it was the practice to divide or separate the
animals offered in sacrifice, so as to make a passage-way
between them, as through a door or gate, and
to pour out the blood of the victims on the earth
between the two portions, so that the offerer, or the
one welcomed, might pass over, or step across, that
blood, as in a threshold covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been noted that when General Grant
came to the border line of Assioot, in Upper Egypt,
as he landed from his Nile boat, a bullock was sacrificed
in covenant welcome, its head being put on one
side of the gang-plank, and its body on the other;
while its blood was between the two, so that it should
be stepped over in the act of landing.<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c012'><sup>[512]</sup></a> And every
year, when the great Hajj procession returns from
Meccah to Syria, it is welcomed, as it approaches
Damascus, by just such sacrifices as this. Sheep and
oxen are sacrificed before the caravan, their blood
being poured out in the middle of the road, and their
bodies being divided and placed on either side of the
way. Then those who approach by this “new and
living way,”<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c012'><sup>[513]</sup></a> on the boundary line of their country,
renew their covenant with those within, by passing
over the blood.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c012'><sup>[514]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be a reference to such a mode of
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>boundary sacrifices, in the description of the Lord’s
covenant welcome to Abraham, on the border of the
land promised to him for a possession.<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c012'><sup>[515]</sup></a> Abraham
was near the southern boundary of Canaan. He had
the promise of the Lord, that he and his seed should
possess that land; but as yet he was childless, and he
had no control over any portion of the land. He
naturally desired some tangible assurance, in accordance
with the customs of mankind, that the Lord’s
promises to him would be made good. Therefore
when the Lord said to him, “I am the Lord that
brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee
this land to inherit it,” Abraham replied with the
question, “O Lord God, whereby shall I know that I
shall inherit it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Lord responded with these directions,
apparently in accordance with a well-known mode of
covenanting among men: “Take me an heifer of three
years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram
of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young
pigeon.” Abraham seems to have understood what
was to be done with these victims for sacrifice. “And
he took him all these, and divided them in the midst,
and laid each half over against the other: but the
birds divided he not.” The blood of the victims was
doubtless poured out on the earth where they were
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>sacrificed, midway between the places of the divided
portions, as is the present custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down,
and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace [or brazier,
or censer], and a flaming torch [a fire and a light as a
symbol of the Divine presence] that passed [covenant-crossed
the blood on the threshold] between these
pieces.” And the record adds: “In that day the
Lord made a covenant [a border-altar covenant] with
Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land,
from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river
Euphrates: the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the
Kadmonite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the
Rephaim, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and
the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus Abram was assured that the Lord had covenanted
to protect his boundaries; as Nebuchadrezzar
long afterward desired that his god Nebo would protect
his empire boundary or threshold. As to the
fact of boundary sacrifices in these lands and elsewhere,
in those days and earlier, there would seem to
be no room for question.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not to be expected that border sacrifices would
at all times, and in all places, be just alike; but a
common primitive symbolism would be likely to show
itself in them all. In Persia, these sacrifices are still
common, when one is to be received with honors at
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>the border of a new territory or jurisdiction.<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c012'><sup>[516]</sup></a> Morier,
describing his journey through Persia, in the early
part of this century, speaks of the first entrance of a
new ruler into the territory he was to govern. “The
khan, with all his attendants, accompanied us about
two miles. He was preparing to enter Bushire, his
new government, with all splendor. From the town
to the swamps [from the territorial border to the border
of the capital] were erected stages on which bullocks
were to be sacrificed, and from which their
heads were to be thrown under his horse’s feet as he
advanced; a ceremony, indeed, appropriated to princes
alone, and to them only on particular occasions.”<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c012'><sup>[517]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>On another occasion, when the British envoy approached
Kauzeroon, on a visit of ceremony, he was
welcomed at the threshold of the town by a corresponding
ceremony. “A bottle which contained
sugar candy was broken under the feet of the envoy’s
horse, a ceremony never practiced in Persia to any
but to royal personages.”<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c012'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>the gates “oxen and sheep in great numbers were
sacrificed just as he passed, and their heads thrown
under his horse’s feet.” And “glass vases filled with
sugar were broken before him.” On this occasion the
Shah frequently looked at a watch, “anxious that he
should enter the gates exactly at the time prescribed
by the astrologers” for his crossing the threshold.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c012'><sup>[519]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>More recently, Layard has testified to the prevalence
of such customs. Speaking of his reception
among the Yezidis, he tells of his approach to the village
of Guzelder, and of his welcome there: “The
head of the village of Guzelder, with the principal
inhabitants, had come to invite me to eat bread in his
house, and we followed him.... Before we reached
Guzelder, the procession had swollen to many hundreds....
As I approached, sheep were brought into
the road and slain before my horse’s feet, and as we
entered the yard of Akko’s house the women and men
joined in the loud and piercing ‘<em>tahlel</em>.’”<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c012'><sup>[520]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Again, as Layard entered the village of Redwan,
he was similarly welcomed. “I alighted,” he says,
“amidst the din of music and the ‘<em>tahlel</em>’ at the
house of Nazi, the chief of the whole Yezidi district;
two sheep being slain before me as I took my feet
from the stirrups.”<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c012'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>When, some twenty years ago, a European prince
visited the Mt. Lebanon region,<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c012'><sup>[522]</sup></a> a generous host
killed a valuable cow on the road by which the prince
must come into his region. Then the royal visitor
and his retinue were requested to step over, not upon,
the blood of the slaughtered cow, at the threshold of
that host’s domain.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the occasion of a caravan starting out from the
boundary line of a country in the East, there are border
sacrifices offered, even in recent times. Thus
Burckhardt tells of this ceremony, when he went from
Egypt to Nubia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The various traders going with this caravan assembled
at the starting-point, having their goods with
them. “At noon the camels were watered, and knelt
down by the side of their respective loads. Just
before the lading commenced, the Ababde women
appeared with earth vessels in their hands, filled with
burning coals. They set them before the several
loads, and threw salt upon them.” It has already
been shown that salt stands for blood, in the minds of
primitive peoples. “At the rising of the bluish flame
produced by the burning of the salt, they exclaimed,
‘May you be blessed in going and in coming!’”<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c012'><sup>[523]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>And this sacrifice was supposed to secure safety
against evil spirits encountered in crossing the boundary
line.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it would seem that, from the beginning, on
the national threshold, as on the threshold of the
temple and of the home, sacrifices were offered, and
boundary marks were set up, in recognition of a peculiar
sacredness of the border line,–which is in itself a
foundation and a limit. These boundary marks were
commonly a pillar or a tree, in apparent symbolism
of a fructifying or a fruit-bearing agency, of the transmission
or the continuance of life. And the establishment
and protection of these boundary marks was
deemed well pleasing to God or to the gods, and in
the nature of a holy covenant service.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
  <h2 class='c005'>IV. <br /> ORIGIN OF THE RITE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1.  A NATURAL QUESTION.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A question that forces itself on the mind, in connection
with the study of a world-wide primitive rite
like this of the Threshold Covenant, is, What was its
origin? How came it to pass, that primitive peoples,
in all parts of the world, were brought to attach such
exceptionally sacred significance to the threshold of
a hut, or tent, or cave, or house; of a palace or temple;
of a domain, local or national; and to count its
crossing by blood a form of holy covenanting between
the parties engaged in it, and the deity invoked in the
ceremony? This question goes back to the origin of
religious rites among human beings, and its answer
must, in order to commend itself to all, be in accordance
with the natural outgrowths and the abnormal
perversions of religious rites, in the main line of
human development all the world over.</p>

<p class='c000'>However simple and elemental were man’s earliest
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>religious ideas, they must have been from the beginning
pure and uplifting, or they would not have been
religious. Nothing impure or debasing in itself would
have raised man’s thoughts Godward, even though
man might subsequently come to degrade his best
conceptions of God and his worship. Hence the
answer to this question must include only such facts
as were capable of being viewed reverently by primitive
man, as worthy of God’s creatures in the loving
service and worship of God.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. AN ANSWER BY INDUCTION.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This threshold rite clearly goes back to the beginning
of family life. The facts already presented are
proof of this. The rite includes the proffer of blood
at the foundation of the family as a family. It is a
part of the marriage ceremonial among primitive peoples.
It is also the means by which one is adopted
from without into a family circle or group. It marks
every stage of the progress of family life, from one
pair to a community and to an empire, in its civil and
religious relations. It is a form of covenanting between
its participants, and between them and God;
and thus it has sanctity as a religious rite.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fair induction from these recognized facts, in
their sweep and significance, would seem to indicate,
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>as the origin of this primitive rite, the covenant union
between the first pair in their instituting of the family
relation. When was the first covenant made between
two human beings? When was the first outpouring
of blood in loving sacrifice? By what act was the
first appeal made to the Author and Source of life for
power for the transmission of life, by two persons who
thereby entered into covenant with each other and
with him? The obvious answer to these questions
is an answer to the question, What was the origin of
the rite of the Threshold Covenant?</p>

<p class='c000'>Life and its transmission must have been a sacred
mystery to the first thinkers about God and his human
workers. Blood was early recognized as life, its outpouring
as the pledge and gift of life, and its interchange
as a life covenant between those who shared
its substance. In view of this truth, a covenant union
by blood that looked to the transmission of life must
have been in itself, to a thoughtful and reverent person,
an appeal to the Author of life to be a party to
that covenant union, in order to give it efficiency.</p>

<p class='c000'>When first a twain were made one in a covenant of
blood, the threshold altar of the race was hallowed as
a place where the Author of life met and blessed the
loving union. And from this beginning there was the
natural development of religious rites and ceremonies,
in the family, in the temple, and in the domain, as
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>shown alike in the history of the human race and in
the main teachings of both the Old Testament and
the New.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. NO COVENANT WITHOUT BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Flowing blood is widely deemed essential to the
covenant by which two are made one in the marriage
relation. This is peculiarly the case among those
primitive peoples where young maidens are guarded
with jealous care, and are given in marriage at a very
early age. In the thought of such peoples there is no
binding covenant without blood, in the family relation.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c012'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
And a bloody hand stamp on the cloth of
testimony is the primitive certificate of the marriage
covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Facts in illustration of this truth are numerous in
the nuptial customs of Syria, Egypt, China, Dahomey,
Liberia, Europe, Central America, Samoa, and other
widely different regions. A few of these facts are
given in the Appendix for the benefit of scientific
students, in a language better suited than English for
the presentation of such details.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c012'><sup>[525]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>4. CONFIRMATION OF THIS VIEW.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>If the view here given of the origin of this rite of
the Threshold Covenant be correct, there will be
found traces of the truth in the different religions of
mankind. And this is the case, as shown in religious
literatures, in history, and in primitive customs and
beliefs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most ancient expression of the religious
thought and feeling of the Aryan races is found in the
Vedas and their accompanying literature. The Brahmanas,
in this literature, deal with the sacrificial element
in public and family worship, and with the rites
and ceremonies pertaining to religion. In the description
of the construction of the household altars and
the high altars, there is abundant evidence that the
woman is recognized as the primitive altar, and that
the form of the woman is made the pattern of the
altar form.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is distinctly declared as to the shape of the altar,
standing east and west, that it “should be broader on
the west side, contracted on the middle, and broad
again on the east side; for thus shaped they praise a
woman: ‘broad about the hips, somewhat narrower
between the shoulders, and contracted in the middle
[or about the waist].’” Again, it is said, in explanation,
that “the altar (<em>vedi</em>, feminine) is female, and the
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>fire (<em>agni</em>, masculine) is male.”<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c012'><sup>[526]</sup></a> This identifying of
the altar with the woman, of the offering with the
man, and of their union with worship and covenanting,
is repeatedly found in the Brahmanas.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c012'><sup>[527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Even as far back as the Vedas themselves the term
<em>yoni</em>, or doorway of physical life, is used as synonymous
with altar.<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c012'><sup>[528]</sup></a> And the production of sacred fire, for
purposes of worship, by twisting a stick in softened
wood, is described in the Rig-Vedas as a form of this
covenant rite. These facts point to this origin of the
threshold altar of covenant and sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c000'>At present in India the most widely recognized visible
aid in worship is the representation of the <em>linga</em>
and the <em>yoni</em> combined. This symbol nominally stands
for Siva; but that seems to be only because Saivism
predominates in modern Hindooism. The idea of
this symbolic combination long antedates this prominence
of Siva worship.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c012'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>A form of Booddhist prayer in Tibet, said to be
repeated more frequently than any other known
among men, is “the six-syllabled sentence, ‘<em>Om mani
padme Hūm</em>,’–‘Om! the Jewel in the Lotus! Hum!’”
This prayer is simply a euphemism for the primitive
Threshold Covenant, as here explained, with an ejaculatory
invocation and ascription before and after it.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c012'><sup>[530]</sup></a>
It seems to be a survival of the thought that here
was the beginning of religious rites, and that all covenant
worship must continue in its spirit and power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every repetition of that prayer, by speech or by
mechanism, is supposed to affect the progress of a
soul in its crossing the threshold of one of the stages
of being in the universe. It is a help to a new birth
for some soul somewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>There would thus appear to be no room for doubt
in this matter in the language and customs of the
primitive Aryan peoples, and there are also confirmations
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>of the idea among the Semites. A legend that
has a place among the Jews and the Muhammadans,
tells of a visit of Abraham to the home of Hagar and
Ishmael in Arabia.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c012'><sup>[531]</sup></a> An Amalekite wife of Ishmael
refused hospitality to Abraham, and in consequence
Abraham left a message to Ishmael to “change his
threshold.” This message Ishmael understood to
mean the putting away of his wife and the taking of
another, and he acted accordingly. In the Arabic “a
wife” is one of the meanings of the term “threshold.”<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c012'><sup>[532]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And the term “gate,” or “door,” had among the rabbis
a specific application to the altar of family covenanting.
Thus Buxtorf, in his definings of “<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">janua</span></em>”
and “<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ostium</span></em>,” says plainly: “<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apud rabbinos etiam est
‘ostium ventris muliebris.’</span></em>” And he quotes the saying
of a disappointed bridegroom : “<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostium apertum
inveni.</span></em>”<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c012'><sup>[533]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among the early Babylonians and Egyptians, as
among other primitive peoples, the twofold symbols
of sex are counted the sacred emblem of life, and as
such are borne by the gods of life, and by those who
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>have the power of life and death from those gods.
The circle and rod, or ring and bolt, conjoined, are in
the right hand of the Babylonian sun-god Shamash;<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c012'><sup>[534]</sup></a>
as, in the <em>ankh</em>, or <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">crux ansata</span></em>, they are in the right
hand of every principal deity of ancient Egypt.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c012'><sup>[535]</sup></a> It is
much the same with the Phœnicians and others.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c012'><sup>[536]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the innermost shrine of the most sacred Shinto
temples of Japan, the circular mirror, and the straight
dagger, with the same meaning as the circle and rod
in Babylonia and Egypt and Phœnicia, are the only
indications of the presence of deity; and the worshipers
in those temples can come no farther than the
threshold of the shrine containing these emblems.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c012'><sup>[537]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Wherever, among the primitive peoples in America,
as elsewhere, the red hand is found as a symbol of
covenant, and of life and strength through covenant,
it would seem to point to this primal meaning of the
hand stamp of blood at the doorway of life in a sacred
covenant. There are indications in Central American
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>sculptures of the sacredness attaching to the covenant
rite between the first pair; and the combined symbols
of sex are represented there as in the East.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c012'><sup>[538]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>It is a well-known fact that the public exhibit of the
primitive Threshold Covenant, as here explained, has
been continued as a mode of reverent worship among
primitive peoples in the South Sea Islands, down to
modern times. The testimony of Captain Cook, the
famous navigator, is specific on this point.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c012'><sup>[539]</sup></a> It is also
to be noted that in these islands the two supports of
the altar, or table of sacrifice, are seemingly symbols
of the two sexes, similar to those used in the far East.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c012'><sup>[540]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>All of the gathered facts concerning the Threshold
Covenant in different lands and in different times, as
presented in the foregoing pages, would seem to be
in accordance with this view of the origin of the rite,
as with no other that can be suggested. The main
symbolism of both the Old and the New Testament
also seem to indicate the same beginning.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>
  <h2 class='c005'>V. <br /> HEBREW PASS-OVER, OR CROSS-OVER, <br /> SACRIFICE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1. NEW MEANING IN AN OLD RITE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>How the significance of the Hebrew passover rite
stands out in the light of this primitive custom! It is
not that this rite had its origin in the days of the
Hebrew exodus from Egypt, but that Jehovah then
and there emphasized the meaning and sacredness of
a rite already familiar to Orientals. In dealing with
his chosen people, God did not invent a new rite or
ceremonial at every stage of his progressive revelation
to them; but he took a rite with which they were
already familiar, and gave to it a new and deeper significance
in its new use and relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Long before that day, a covenant welcome was given
to a guest who was to become as one of the family,
or to a bride or bridegroom in marriage, by the outpouring
of blood on the threshold of the door, and by
staining the doorway itself with the blood of the covenant.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>And now Jehovah announced that he was to
visit Egypt on a designated night, and that those who
would welcome him should prepare a threshold covenant,
or a pass-over sacrifice, as a proof of that welcome;
for where no such welcome was made ready
for him by a family, he must count the household as
his enemy.<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c012'><sup>[541]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In announcing this desire for a welcoming sacrifice
by the Hebrews, God spoke of it as “Jehovah’s passover,”
as if the pass-over rite was a familiar one, which
was now to be observed as a welcome to Jehovah.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c012'><sup>[542]</sup></a>
Moses, in reporting the Lord’s message to the Hebrews,
did not speak of the proposed sacrifice as something
of which they knew nothing until now, but he
first said to them, “Draw out, and take you lambs
according to your families, and kill the passover”–or
the threshold cross-over;<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c012'><sup>[543]</sup></a> and then he added details
of special instruction for this new use of the old rite.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. A WELCOME WITH BLOOD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A lamb was the chosen sacrifice in the welcome to
Jehovah. Each household, or family, was to take one
lamb for this offering. No directions were given as
to the place or manner of its sacrifice; for that seems
to have been understood by all, because of the very
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>term “pass-over,” or threshold cross-over. This is
implied, indeed, in the directions for the use of the
blood when it was poured out: “Kill the passover,”
in the usual place; “and ye shall take a bunch of
hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is at the <em>threshold</em>
[Hebrew, <em>saph</em>], and strike the lintel and the two
side posts with the blood that is at the <em>threshold</em>.”<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c012'><sup>[544]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In that welcome with blood there was covenant
protection from Jehovah as he came into Egypt to
execute judgment on his enemies. The Egyptians
had already refused him allegiance, and put themselves
in open defiance of his authority. They were
now to be visited in judgment.<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c012'><sup>[545]</sup></a> But in order to the
distinguishing of the Lord’s people from his enemies,
the Hebrews were to prepare a blood welcome at their
doorway, and the Lord would honor this welcome by
covenanting with those who proffered it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord, About midnight
will I go out into the midst of Egypt: and all
the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even
unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind
the mill; and all the firstborn of cattle.... But against
any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>how that the Lord doth put a difference between the
Egyptians and Israel.”<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c012'><sup>[546]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In furtherance of this purpose, the Lord asked for
the sacrifice of the threshold cross-over by the Hebrews:
“For the Lord will pass through [the land]
to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood
upon the lintel, and on the two side posts [of the
Hebrew homes], the Lord will pass over [cross-over
or through] the door, and will not suffer the destroyer
to come in unto your houses to smite you.”<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c012'><sup>[547]</sup></a> Obviously
the figure here employed is of a sovereign accompanied
by his executioner, a familiar figure in the
ancient East. When he comes to a house marked by
tokens of the welcoming covenant, the sovereign will
covenant-cross that threshold, and enter the home as
a guest, or as a member of the family; but where no
such preparation has been made for him, his executioner
will enter on his mission of judgment.<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c012'><sup>[548]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>3.  BASON, OR THRESHOLD.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It is strange that the Hebrew word for “threshold”
(<em>saph</em>) in this narrative is translated “bason” in our
English Bible. It is because of this that the identity
of the passover sacrifice with the primitive Threshold
Covenant is so generally lost sight of. This word
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span><em>saph</em> occurs many times in the Old Testament text,
and in nine cases out of ten it is translated “threshold,”
or “door,” or “door-post,” or the like.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c012'><sup>[549]</sup></a> It would
seem that it should be so translated in this instance.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some cases where <em>saph</em> is translated “bason,” or
“cup,” the term “threshold” would be more appropriate,
as when included in an enumeration of the
temple furniture.<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c012'><sup>[550]</sup></a> Bronze and silver thresholds were
often mentioned in the furniture of Babylonian and
Assyrian temples;<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c012'><sup>[551]</sup></a> and they might well have had
mention among the Hebrews. It is possible, however,
that there was a cavity, as a blood receptacle, in the
threshold of houses or temples where sacrifices were
so frequent; and this would account for the use of
the word <em>saph</em> as “bason,” even where it referred to
the threshold of the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The translators of the Septuagint, living in Egypt
and familiar with the customs of that land, rendered
<em>saph</em> by <em>thyra</em>, “doorway,”<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c012'><sup>[552]</sup></a> in the story of the
exodus. Jerome, with his understanding of Oriental
life, gives <em>limen</em>, “threshold,” for <em>saph</em>, at this point.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c012'><sup>[553]</sup></a>
Philo Judæus, out of his Egyptian Jewish experiences,
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>describing the Jewish passover festival, speaks of it as
“the feast <em>diabateria</em>, which the Jews called <em>paskha</em>.”<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c012'><sup>[554]</sup></a>
“<em>Diabateria</em>” are “offerings before crossing a border,”<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c012'><sup>[555]</sup></a>
or threshold sacrifices. Rabbi Ishmael, a Talmudist,
in explaining the passage descriptive of the institution
of the passover in Egypt, says: “One dug a hole in
the [earthen] threshold, and slaughtered into that,”
“for <em>saph</em> signifies here nothing else than threshold.”<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c012'><sup>[556]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A striking illustration of the error of translating
<em>saph</em> “a bason” or “a cup,” is shown in the rendering
of Zechariah 12 : 1–3 in our English Bible. The
Lord is there promising to protect the borders of Jerusalem
against all besiegers. “Thus saith the Lord,
which ... layeth the foundation of the earth:... Behold,
I will make Jerusalem a <em>threshold</em> [or, boundary
stone, Hebrew, <em>saph</em>] of reeling unto all the peoples
round about.... I will make Jerusalem a burdensome
stone for all the peoples.” The figure seems to be
that of the besiegers staggering as they come against
that foundation, or threshold stone, which the Lord
has established. Yet <em>saph</em> is here translated “cup,”
and the passage thereby rendered meaningless.</p>

<p class='c000'>There would seem, indeed, to be little room for
doubt that <em>saph</em> should be translated “threshold” in
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>the description of the pass-over sacrifice. In Assyrian,
the word <em>sippu</em>, from the same root as the Hebrew
<em>saph</em>, means only threshold, not bason or cup.<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c012'><sup>[557]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. PASS-OVER OR PASS-BY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The common understanding of the term “passover,”
in connection with the Hebrew exodus from Egypt, is
that it was, on the Lord’s part, a passing by those
homes where the doorways were blood-stained, without
entering them. Yet this meaning is not justified
by the term itself, nor by the significance of the primitive
rite. Jehovah did not merely spare his people
when he visited judgment on the Egyptians. He
covenanted anew with them by passing over, or crossing
over, the blood-stained threshold into their homes,
while his messenger of death went into the houses of
the Lord’s enemies and claimed the first-born as belonging
to Jehovah.<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c012'><sup>[558]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>This word <em>pesakh</em>, translated “passover,” is a peculiar
one. Its etymology and root meaning have been
much in discussion. It is derived from the root
<em>pāsăkh</em> “to cross over,” a meaning which is still preserved
in the Hebrew word <em>Tiphsakh</em>, the name of a
city on the banks of the Euphrates,<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c012'><sup>[559]</sup></a> the Hebrew
equivalent of the classical Thapsacus.<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c012'><sup>[560]</sup></a> <em>Tiphsakh</em> means
“crossing,” apparently so called from the ford of the
Euphrates at that place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later Jewish traditions and customs point to the
meaning of the original passover rite as a crossing
over the threshold of the Hebrew homes by Jehovah,
and not of his passing by his people in order to their
sparing. A custom by which a Hebrew slave became
one of the family in a Hebrew household, through
having his ear bored with an awl at the door-post of
the house, and thereby blood staining the doorway,<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c012'><sup>[561]</sup></a>
is connected with the passover rite by the rabbis.
“The Deity said: The door and the side-posts were
my witnesses in Egypt, in the hour when I passed-over
the lintel and the two side-posts, and I said that
to Me the children of Israel shall be slaves, and not
slaves to slaves; I brought them out from bondage
to freedom; and this man who goeth and taketh a
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>lord to himself shall be bored through before these
witnesses.”<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c012'><sup>[562]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>According to Jewish traditions, it was on a passover
night when Jehovah entered into a cross-over covenant
with Abraham on the boundary of his new possessions
in Canaan.<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c012'><sup>[563]</sup></a> It was on a passover night that
Lot welcomed the angel visitors to his home in Sodom.<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c012'><sup>[564]</sup></a>
It was at the passover season that the Israelites crossed
the threshold of their new home in Canaan, when the
walls of Jericho fell down, and the blood-colored
thread on the house of Rahab was a symbol of the
covenant of the Hebrew spies with her and her household.<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c012'><sup>[565]</sup></a>
The protection of the Israelites against the
Midianites,<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c012'><sup>[566]</sup></a> and the Assyrians,<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c012'><sup>[567]</sup></a> and the Medes and
the Persians,<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c012'><sup>[568]</sup></a> and again the final overthrow of Babylon,<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c012'><sup>[569]</sup></a>
all these events were said to have been at the
passover season.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c012'><sup>[570]</sup></a> These traditions would seem to
show that the pass-over covenant was deemed a cross-over
covenant, and a covenant of welcome at the family
and the national threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the passover rite as observed by modern Jews, at
a certain stage of the feast the outer door is opened,
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>and an extra cup and chair are arranged at the table,
in the hope that God’s messenger will cross the threshold,
and enter the home as a welcome guest.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c012'><sup>[571]</sup></a> All this
points to the meaning of “cross-over,” and not of
“pass-by.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In some parts of northern and eastern Europe there
is a custom still preserved among the Jews of jumping
over a tub of water on passover night, which is said to
be symbolic of crossing the Red Sea, but which shows
that the passover feast was a feast of crossing over.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c012'><sup>[572]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>5. MARRIAGE OF JEHOVAH WITH ISRAEL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>It seems clear that the Egyptian passover rite was
a rite of threshold covenanting, as ordered of God and
as understood by the Israelites. Its sacrifice was on
the threshold of the homes of the Hebrews on the
threshold of a new year,<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c012'><sup>[573]</sup></a> and on the threshold of a
new nationality. Then Israel began anew in all
things. Moreover, it was recognized as the rite of
marriage between Jehovah and Israel; as the very
Threshold Covenant had its origin in the rite of primitive
marriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>That first passover night was the night when Jehovah
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>took to himself in covenant union the “Virgin of
Israel,” and became a Husband unto her. From that
time forward any recognition of, or affiliation with,
another God, is called “whoredom,” “adultery,” or
“fornication.”<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c012'><sup>[574]</sup></a> In this light it is that the prophets
always speak of idolatry.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jeremiah recognizes the first passover night as the
time of this marriage covenant, when he says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah,</div>
      <div class='line'>That I will make a new covenant</div>
      <div class='line'>With the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</div>
      <div class='line'>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers</div>
      <div class='line'>In the day that I took them by the hand</div>
      <div class='line'>To bring them out of the land of Egypt;</div>
      <div class='line'>Which my covenant they brake,</div>
      <div class='line'>Although I was an husband unto them, saith Jehovah.”<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c012'><sup>[575]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>And Jehovah, speaking through Ezekiel of his loving
choice of the Hebrew daughter of the Amorite and
the Hittite, says: “Now when I passed by thee, and
looked upon thee, behold, thy time was the time of
love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered
thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered
into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and
thou becamest mine.”<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c012'><sup>[576]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>It seems to be in recognition of the truth that the
Egyptian passover was the rite of marriage between
Jehovah and Israel, that the Song of Songs, the epithalamium
of the Hebrew Scriptures, is always read in
the synagogue at the passover service. This idea of
the relation of Jehovah and Israel runs through the
entire Old Testament, and shows itself in the Jewish
ritual of to-day.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the primitive marriage rite the stamp of the red
hand of the bridegroom is the certification of the covenant
union, at the doorway of the family. But in the
Egyptian passover it was the virgin of Israel who
certified to the marriage covenant by the bloody
stamp on the doorway. Hence it was a feminine
symbol, in a bush of hyssop, that was dipped in the
blood and used for this stamping.<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c012'><sup>[577]</sup></a> The tree, or bush,
is a universal symbol of the feminine in nature. This
is shown, for example, in the tree or brush-topped
pole as the symbol of Ashtaroth, “wife,”<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c012'><sup>[578]</sup></a> as over
against the pillar or obelisk as the symbol of Baal,
or “lord,” or “husband.”<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c012'><sup>[579]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c005'>VI. <br /> CHRISTIAN PASSOVER.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1. OLD COVENANT AND NEW.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In the New Testament the rites and symbols of
the Old Testament find recognition and explanation.
This is peculiarly true of the passover service. It was
a central fact in the gospel story. The sacrifice, or
offering, of Jesus Christ as the Saviour, was made at
that season;<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c012'><sup>[580]</sup></a> and it was evident that he himself felt
that  it was essential that this be  so. He held  back
from Jerusalem until the approach of the passover
feast, when he knew that his death was at hand.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c012'><sup>[581]</sup></a>
And his last passover meal was made the basis of the
new memorial and symbolic covenant meal with his
disciples.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c012'><sup>[582]</sup></a> The passover sacrifice is as prominent in
the New Testament as in the Old.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul, familiar with Jewish customs by study and
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>experience, writing to Corinthian Christians of their
duty and privileges as members of the household of
faith, urges them to make a new beginning in their
lives, as the Israelites made a new beginning on the
threshold of every year at the passover festival, with
its accompanying feast of unleavened bread, when all
the lay-over leaven from a former state was put away.
“Purge out the old leaven,” he says, “that ye may be
a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our
passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ.”<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c012'><sup>[583]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. PROFFERED WELCOME BY THE FATHER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The primitive passover sacrifice was an offering of
blood by the head of the household on the threshold
of his home, as a token of his welcome to the guest
who would cross over that blood and thereby become
one with the family within. It was not an outsider
or a stranger who proffered a threshold sacrifice, but
it was the house-father who thus extended a welcome
to one who was yet outside. The welcoming love
was measured by the preciousness of the sacrifice.
The richer the offering, the heartier the welcome.<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c012'><sup>[584]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the Egyptian passover the threshold sacrifice
was a proffer of welcome to Jehovah by the collective
family in each Hebrew home. In the Christian passover
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>it was the sacrifice of the Son of God on the
threshold of the Father’s home, the home of the family
of the redeemed, as a proffer of welcome to whoever
outside would cross the outpoured blood, and become
a member of the family within. Therefore it is written:
“God so loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should
not perish, but have eternal life.”<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c012'><sup>[585]</sup></a> And “for this
cause,” says Paul, “I bow my knees unto the Father,
from whom every family in heaven and on earth is
named.”<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c012'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Among primitive peoples, as among the Jews, no
indignity could equal the refusal of a proffered guest-welcome,
in a rude trampling on the blood of the
threshold sacrifice, instead of crossing over it reverently
as a mode of its acceptance. Hence the peculiar
force of the words of the Jewish-Christian writer of
the Epistle to the Hebrews, concerning the mistreatment
of God’s threshold sacrifice, in the Son of God
offered as our passover: “A man that hath set at
nought Moses’ law dieth without compassion on the
word of two or three witnesses: of how much sorer
punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy, who
hath <em>trodden under foot the Son of God</em>, and hath
counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>sanctified [separated from the outside world], an unholy
[a common] thing, and hath done despite unto
the Spirit of grace?”<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c012'><sup>[587]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. BRIDEGROOM AND BRIDE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>All through the New Testament, Jesus, the outpouring
of whose blood is “our passover” welcome
from the Father, is spoken of as the Bridegroom, and
his church as the Bride. His coming to earth is referred
to as the coming of the Bridegroom–as was
the coming of Jehovah to the Virgin of Israel in
Egypt. He likened himself to a bridegroom. And
his coming again to his church is foretold as the
meeting of the Bridegroom and the Bride.</p>

<p class='c000'>John the Baptist, forerunner of Jesus, speaking of
his mission as closing, and that of Jesus as opening
out gloriously, says: “Ye yourselves bear me witness,
that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent
before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom:
but the friend of the bridegroom, which
standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because
of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is
fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease.”<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c012'><sup>[588]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Jesus, referring to the charge against his disciples,
that they did not fast, as did the disciples of John,
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>said: “Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, as
long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then will they fast.”<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c012'><sup>[589]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Paul repeatedly refers to this relation between Christ
and his church: “The head of every man is Christ;
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head
of Christ is God.”<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c012'><sup>[590]</sup></a> “The husband is the head of the
wife, as Christ also is the head of the church....
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved
the church, and gave himself up for it.... He that
loveth his own wife loveth himself: for no man ever
hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
even as Christ also the church; because we are members
of his body. For this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife;
and the twain shall become one flesh. This mystery
is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the
church.”<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c012'><sup>[591]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the Apocalypse, the inspired seer looking into
the future, at the consummation of the present age,
tells of the glorious vision before him, when Christ
shall come to claim his own: “I heard as it were the
voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying,
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>Hallelujah: for the Lord our God, the Almighty,
reigneth. Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and
let us give the glory unto him: for the marriage of the
Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.
And it was given unto her that she should array herself
in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is
the righteous acts of the saints. And he saith unto
me, Write, Blessed are they which are bidden to the
marriage supper of the Lamb.”<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c012'><sup>[592]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>And again he says: “I saw the holy city, new
Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
made ready as a bride adorned for her husband....
And there came one of the seven angels; ... and he
spake with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee
the bride, the wife of the Lamb. And he carried me
away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and
shewed me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out
of heaven from God, having the glory of God: ...
having a wall great and high; having twelve gates.
And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God the
Almighty, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof....
And the gates thereof shall in no wise be shut by day
(for there shall be no night there): and they shall
bring the glory and the honor of the nations into
it: and there shall in no wise enter into it anything
unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie:
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>but only they which are written in the Lamb’s book
of life.”<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c012'><sup>[593]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>A closing declaration of the seer is, that the church
as the Bride, with the representative of the Bridegroom
until his coming, waits and calls for his return:
“The Spirit and the bride say, Come.... Come,
Lord Jesus.”<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c012'><sup>[594]</sup></a> And so, from the Pentateuch to the
Apocalypse, the Scriptures, Hebrew and Christian,
recognize and emphasize the primitive Threshold
Covenant as the beginning of religious rites, and as
symbolic of the spirit of all true covenant worship.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>4. SURVIVALS OF THE RITE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Survivals of the primitive Threshold Covenant are
found in various customs among Oriental Christians,
and Christians the world over. Thus Easter is still
looked at in some regions as the continuance of Passover,
and the blood on the threshold is an accompaniment
of the feast. Among the modern Greeks, each
family, as a rule, buys a lamb, kills it, and eats it on
Easter Sunday. “In some country districts the blood
[of the lamb] is sometimes smeared on the threshold
of the house.”<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c012'><sup>[595]</sup></a> Easter, like the Jewish Passover, is
the threshold of the new ecclesiastical year.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, in Jerusalem,
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>a principal incident in the Easter festivities is the
bringing down of fire from heaven at the opening of
the new ecclesiastical year.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c012'><sup>[596]</sup></a> This ceremony seems to
be a survival of the primitive custom of seeking new
life, in its symbol of fire, at the threshold of the home
and of the new year, in the East and in the West.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c012'><sup>[597]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the sacredness of the rite of the primitive Threshold
Covenant there is added emphasis to the thought
which causes both the Roman Catholic Church and
the Greek Church to count marriage itself a sacrament.
And thus again to the claim that a virgin who
is devoted to a religious life is a “spouse of Christ,”
and that her marriage to an earthly husband is adultery.<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c012'><sup>[598]</sup></a>
Many another religious custom points in the
same direction.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
  <h2 class='c005'>VII. <br /> OUTGROWTHS AND PERVERSIONS <br /> OF THIS RITE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c010'>1. ELEMENTAL BEGINNINGS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Apart from the mooted question of the origin and
development of man as man,–whether it be held that
he came into being as an incident in the evolutionary
progress of the ages, or that his creation was by a
special fiat of the Author of all things,–it is obvious
that there was a beginning, when man first appeared
as a higher order of being than the lower animals
then in existence. The distinguishing attribute of
man, as distinct from the lower animals at their best,
is the capacity to conceive of spiritual facts and forces.
Even at his lowest estate man is never without an
apprehension of immaterial and supernatural personalities,
intangible yet real and potent. The lower
animals at their highest, and under the most effective
training, give no indication of the possibility of such a
conception on their part.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>Both the Bible record and the disclosed facts of
science show man at the start in a primitive state,
with only elemental beginnings of knowledge or
thought or skill. No claim is made for him, by any
advocate of his pre-eminence in creation, that he then
had skill in the arts, or attainment in civilization, or
that he was possessed of a religious theory or ritual
of even the simplest character. It is a matter of interest
and importance to trace the course of man’s
progress from the first to the present time, and to see
how the good and the evil showed themselves along
the line, from the same germs of thought and conduct
rightly used or misused. The primitive rite of the
Threshold Covenant, here brought out as initial and
germinative, seems to present a reasonable solution
of the observed course in religious development and
in religious perversions in the history of mankind
from the beginning until now.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before primitive man could have concerned himself
seriously with the course of the heavenly bodies, or
the changes of the seasons, or the points of compass
and the correspondent shifting of the winds, he must
have recognized the sacred mystery of life and its
transmission. It would seem that a covenant involved
in the union of twain made one over outpoured blood,
with power from the Author of life for the transmission
of life, must have been the primal religious
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>rite that brought man’s personal action into the clear
light of a covenant relation with his Creator. Every
subsequent development of the religious idea, good
and bad, pure and impure, would seem to be traceable
as an outgrowth, or as a perversion, of this elemental
religious rite.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>2. MAIN OUTGROWTHS</h3>

<p class='c011'>It would seem clear that the primal idea of a covenant
union between two persons, and between those
persons and their God, was found in the initial and
primitive rite of marriage, with its outpoured blood,
or gift of life, on the threshold of being; and that this
rite contained in itself the germs of covenanting and
of sacrifice, and the idea of an altar and a sacrament,
where, and by which, man and God were brought into
loving communion and union. Thus the beginning
of religious rites was found in the primal Threshold
Covenant as here portrayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out of this beginning came all that is best and
holiest in the thought of sacrifice and sacrament and
spiritual communion. The very highest development
of religious truth, under the guidance of progressive
revelation from God, and of man’s growth in
thought and knowledge with the passing ages, is
directly in the line of this simple and germinal idea.
Both the Bible record and the record of outside history
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>tend to confirm this view of religious rites in
their beginning and progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>New life as a consequence of blood, or life, surrendered
in holy covenanting, is a natural inference
or outgrowth of the truth of the primal Threshold
Covenant. Thus the thought of life after death, in
the resurrection or in metempsychosis, comes with
the recognition of the simple fact of the results of
covenant union in the sight, and with the blessing,
of the Author of life, in the rite of the Threshold
Covenant.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c012'><sup>[599]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The transference of the altar of threshold covenanting,
from the persons of the primary pair in the family
to the hearthstone or entrance threshold of the home
or family doorway, with the accompaniment of fire as
a means of giving and sustaining life to those who sat
at the common table or altar, in the covenant meal or
sacrament of hospitality, brought about the custom
of sacramental communion feasts with guests human
and divine. And so, also, there came the rites of
worship, with the altar of burnt sacrifice or of incense,
and the marriage torch, and the doorway fire, and the
threshold or hearthstone covenant at a wedding. Out
of this thought there came gradually and naturally
the prominence of the altar and the altar fire in private
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>and public worship, as it obtains both in the simpler
and in the more gorgeous ecclesiastical rituals.<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c012'><sup>[600]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In conjunction with the place of fire on the family
altar in the Threshold Covenant, there came naturally
the recognition of fire and warmth and light as gifts
of God for the promotion and preservation of life to
those who were dependent on him. Thus the sun as
the life-giving fire of the universe came to be recognized
as a manifestation of God’s power and love. Its
agency in bringing new life after death, in the course
of the changing seasons, led men to connect the
movements of the heavenly bodies with God’s dealings
with man in the line of his covenant love. The
too common mistake has been of thinking of this view
of celestial nature as the origin of man’s religious
rites, instead of as an outgrowth of the primal religious
rite, which antedated man’s study of, or wonder
over, the workings of the elements and the course of
the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In summing up the results of such a study as this,
of primitive customs and their outgrowth, it is necessary
only to suggest a few of the more prominent
lines of progress from the elemental beginning, leaving
it to the student and thinker to follow out these,
and to find others, in his more careful and further
consideration of the subject in its varied ramifications.
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>It is sufficient now to affirm that the Old Testament
and the New point to this primitive rite of the Threshold
Covenant as a basis of their common religious
ritual; and that gleams of the same germinal idea
show themselves in the best features of all the sacred
books of the ages. It would be easy, did time and
space allow, to follow out in detail the indications that
all modes of worship in sacrifice, in oblation, in praise,
and prayer, in act and in word, are but natural expressions
of desire for covenant union with Deity, and
of joy in the thought of its possession, as based on
the fact of such covenanting sought and found in the
primal religious rite of the human race.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>3. CHIEF PERVERSIONS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>With the world as it is, and with man as he is,
every possibility of good has a corresponding possibility
of evil. Good perverted becomes evil. Truth
which, rightly used, proves a savor of life, will, when
misused, prove a savor of death.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c012'><sup>[601]</sup></a> And that which is
a symbol of truth becomes a means of misleading
when looked at as if it were in itself the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The primitive Threshold Covenant as an elemental
religious rite was holy and pure, and had possibilities
of outgrowth in the direction of high spiritual attainment
and aspiring. But the temptation to uplift the
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>agencies in this rite into objects deemed of themselves
worthy of worship resulted in impurity and deterioration,
by causing the symbol to hide the truth instead
of disclosing it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the earliest forms of a temple as a place of
worship was the ziggurat, or stepped pyramid, erected
as a mighty altar, with its shrine, or holy of holies, at
the summit, wherein a bride of the gods awaited the
coming of the deity to solemnize the primal Threshold
Covenant in expression of his readiness to enter
into loving communion with the children of men.<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c012'><sup>[602]</sup></a>
From this custom the practice of Threshold Covenanting
at the temple doorways became incumbent on
women of all conditions of society at certain times,
and under certain circumstances, in certain portions
of the world, as a proof of their religious devotion,<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c012'><sup>[603]</sup></a>
and thus there grew up all the excesses of sacred
prostitution in different portions of the world.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c012'><sup>[604]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The prominence given to the two factors in the
primitive Threshold Covenant as a sacred religious act,
led to the perversion of the original idea by making the
factors themselves objects of reverence and worship;
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>and separately, or together, they came to be worshiped
with impure and degrading accompaniments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reverence for the phallus, or for phallic emblems,
shows itself in the earliest historic remains of Babylonia,
Assyria, India, China, Japan, Persia, Phrygia,
Phoenicia, Egypt, Abyssinia, Greece, Rome, Germany,
Scandinavia, France, Spain, Great Britain, North and
South America, and the Islands of the Sea. It were
needless to attempt detailed proof of this statement,
in view of all that has been written on the subject by
historians, archæologists, and students of comparative
religions.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c012'><sup>[605]</sup></a> It is enough to suggest that the mistake
has too often been made of supposing that this
“phallic worship” was a primitive conception of a
religious truth, instead of a perversion of the earlier
and purer idea which is at the basis of the highest
religious conceptions, from the beginning until now.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quite as widely extended, in both time and space,
as the worship of the phallus as the symbol of masculine
potency, is the recognition of the tree of life as the
symbol of feminine nature in its fruit-bearing capacity.
A single tree, or a grove of trees, or the lotus flower,
the fig, or the pomegranate, with the peculiar form of
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>their seed capsules, appear in all the earlier religious
symbolisms, over against the phallus in its realistic
or its conventional forms, as representative of reproductive
life.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c012'><sup>[606]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In ancient Assyrian sculpture the most familiar
representation of spiritual blessing was of a winged
deity with a basket and a palm cone, touching with
the cone a sacred tree, or again the person of a
sovereign, as if imparting thereby some special benefit
or power. This representation was long a mystery to
the archeologist, but a recent scholar has shown that
it is an illustration of a practice common in the East
to-day, of carrying a cone of the male palm to a
female palm tree, in order to vitalize it by the pollen.<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c012'><sup>[607]</sup></a>
The cone is one of the conventional forms of the
phallus, worshiped as a symbol in the temples of the
goddesses of the East in earlier days and later.<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c012'><sup>[608]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>Hence this ancient Assyrian representation is an illustration
of the truth that the primitive threshold covenant
was recognized as the type of divine power, and
covenant blessing, imparted to God’s representative,
under the figure of the phallus and the tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would seem, indeed, that the pillar and the tree
came to be the conventional symbols of the male and
female elements erected in front of an altar of worship,<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c012'><sup>[609]</sup></a>
and that, in the deterioration of the ages, these symbols
themselves were worshiped, and their symbolism
was an incentive to varied forms of impurity, instead
of to holy covenanting with God and in God’s service.
Therefore these symbols were deemed by true worshipers
a perversion of an originally sacred rite, and
their destruction was a duty with those who would
restore God’s worship to its pristine purity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the command to Jehovah’s people as to their
treatment of the people of Canaan was: “Take heed
to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants
of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
snare in the midst of thee: but ye shall break down
their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars [or male
symbols], and ye shall cut down their Asherim [or
trees as a female symbol]: for thou shalt worship no
other god: for the Lord [Jehovah], whose name is
Jealous, is a jealous God: lest thou make a covenant
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring
after their gods.”<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c012'><sup>[610]</sup></a> Here is a distinct reference to
the primitive Threshold Covenant in its purity and
sacredness, and to its perversion in the misuse of the
phallus and tree in their symbolism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the command was explicit to the Israelites:
“Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of
tree beside the altar of the Lord thy God, which thou
shalt make thee. Neither shalt thou set thee up a
pillar; which the Lord thy God hateth.”<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c012'><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>From the earliest historic times the serpent seems
to have been accepted as a symbol of the nexus of
union between the two sexes, and to be associated,
therefore, with the pillar and the tree, as suggestive
of the desire that may be good or evil, according to
its right or wrong direction and use. Its place as a
symbol has been at the threshold of palace and temple
and home, with limitless powers of evil in its misuse.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c012'><sup>[612]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>“Mighty snakes standing upright,” together with
“mighty bulls of bronze” were “on the threshold of
the gates” in ancient Babylon.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c012'><sup>[613]</sup></a> A serpent wreathed
the phallus boundary stone (as if suggestive of its
being a thing of life) on the threshold of Babylonian
domains.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c012'><sup>[614]</sup></a> As a symbol of life and life-giving power
the serpent stood erect above the head of the mightiest
kings of Egypt, who gave and took life at their pleasure,<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c012'><sup>[615]</sup></a>
and it even accompanied the winged sun-orb in
its manifestation of light and warmth and life over the
grandest temples of ancient Thebes.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c012'><sup>[616]</sup></a> The Egyptian
goddess Ket, or Kadesh, “Mistress of Heaven,” a
divinity borrowed from the Semites, was represented
as standing on a lioness, with lotus flowers, their
stems coiled in circular form, in her right hand, and
two serpents in her left hand, as she came with her
offering to Min, or Khem, the god of generative force.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c012'><sup>[617]</sup></a>
A similar representation of a goddess of life is found
in ancient Assyrian remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the representation of Nergal, the lord of the
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>under world, in the ancient Babylonian mythology,
the phallus and the serpent were identical.<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c012'><sup>[618]</sup></a> Beltis-Allat,
consort of Nergal, and lady of the under world,
brandished a serpent in either hand. She was guardian
of the waters of life which were under the threshold
of the entrance of her realm.<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c012'><sup>[619]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>That which was primarily a holy instinct became,
in its perversion, a source of evil and a cause of dread;
hence the serpent became a representative of evil
itself, and the conflict with it was the conflict between
good and evil, between light and darkness. This is
shown in the religions of ancient Babylonia, Egypt,
and India, and Phœnicia and Greece, and Mexico and
Peru, and various other countries.<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c012'><sup>[620]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Vishnoo and his wife Lakshmi, from whom, according
to Hindoo teachings, the world was produced, and
by whom it continues or must cease, are represented
as seated on a serpent, as the basis of their life and
power.<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c012'><sup>[621]</sup></a> Siva, also, giver and destroyer of life, is
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>crowned with a serpent, and a serpent is his necklace,
while the symbol of his worship is the <em>linga in yoni</em>.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c012'><sup>[622]</sup></a>
A mode of Hindoo worship includes the placing of a
stone <em>linga</em> between two serpents, and under two trees,
the one a male tree and the other a female tree.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c012'><sup>[623]</sup></a> And
in various ways the serpent appears, in connection
with different Hindoo deities, as the agent of life-giving
or of life-destroying.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c012'><sup>[624]</sup></a> A suggestive representation
of Booddha as the conqueror of desire shows
him seated restfully on a coiled serpent, the hooded
head of which is a screen or canopy above his head.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c012'><sup>[625]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Apollo, son of Zeus, was the slayer of the man-destroying
serpent at Delphi; yet the serpent, when
conquered, became a means of life and inspiration to
others.<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c012'><sup>[626]</sup></a> Æsculapius, the god of healing, a son of
Apollo, was represented by the serpent because he
gave new life to those who were dying. Serpents
were everywhere connected with his worship as a
means of healing.<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c012'><sup>[627]</sup></a> The female oracle who represented
Apollo at Delphi sat on a tripod formed of
entwined serpents.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c012'><sup>[628]</sup></a> Serpents on the head of Medusa
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>were a means of death to the beholder; and these
serpents were given to Medusa instead of hair because
of her faithlessness and sacrilege in the matter of the
Threshold Covenant.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c012'><sup>[629]</sup></a> Thus the good and the evil in
that which the serpent symbolized were shown in the
religions of the nations of antiquity, and serpent worship
became one of the grossest perversions of the
idea of the primitive Threshold Covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in the matter of phallic worship and tree worship,
so in this of the worship of the serpent, it would
seem unnecessary to multiply illustrations of its
prominence in various lands, when so many special
treatises on the subject are already available.<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c012'><sup>[630]</sup></a> It is
only necessary to emphasize anew the fact that the
evident thought of the symbol is an outgrowth or a
perversion of the idea of the primitive Threshold
Covenant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The form of the Bible narrative, portraying the first
temptation and the first sin, seems to show how early the
symbolism of the tree and the serpent was accepted
in popular speech. From that narrative as it stands
it would appear that the first act of human disobedience
was incontinence, in transgression of a specific
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>command to abstain, at least for a time, from carnal
intercourse. Desire, as indicated by the serpent,
prompted to an untimely partaking of the fruit of the
forbidden tree, and the consequences of sin followed.
The results of this act of disobedience, as recorded in
the sacred text,<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c012'><sup>[631]</sup></a> make evident the correctness of this
view of the case. When the Bible narrative was first
written, whenever that was, the terms “tree,”<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c012'><sup>[632]</sup></a> “fruit”
of the tree,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c012'><sup>[633]</sup></a> “knowledge,”<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c012'><sup>[634]</sup></a> “serpent,” were familiar
figures of speech or euphemisms, and their use in the
Bible narrative would not have been misunderstood
by readers generally. Probably there was no question
as to this for many centuries. It was not until the
dull prosaic literalism of the Western mind obscured
the meaning of Oriental figures of speech that there
was any general doubt as to what was affirmed in the
Bible story of the first temptation and disobedience.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c012'><sup>[635]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Philo Judæus at the beginning of the Christian era,
seems to understand this as the meaning of the narrative
in Genesis, and he applies the teachings of that
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>narrative accordingly.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c012'><sup>[636]</sup></a> There are indications that the
rabbis looked similarly at the meaning of the Bible
text. There are traces of this traditional view in different
Jewish writings.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c012'><sup>[637]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Evidently the original meaning was still familiar
in the early Christian ages. But its becoming connected
with false doctrines and heresies, as taught
by the Ophites and other Gnostic sects, seems to
have brought the truth itself into disrepute, and
finally led to its repudiation in favor of a dead
literalism.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c012'><sup>[638]</sup></a> The curse resting on the serpent, in
consequence of the first sin of incontinence, was the
degradation of the primitive impulse,<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c012'><sup>[639]</sup></a> unless uplifted
again by divine inspiration.<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c012'><sup>[640]</sup></a> Because of their breach
of the covenant of divine love our first parents were
expelled from their home of happiness, and the guardians
of the threshold forbade their return to it.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c012'><sup>[641]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In the closing chapters of the New Testament, as in
the opening chapters of the Old, the symbolism of the
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>tree and the serpent, and the covenant relations
involved in crossing the threshold, appear as familiar
and well-understood figures of speech. “The dragon,
the old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan,”<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c012'><sup>[642]</sup></a>
representing unholy desire, is shut out from the precincts
of the New Jerusalem. Within the gates of that
city is there the tree of life watered by the stream that
flows from under the throne of power.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c012'><sup>[643]</sup></a> The city
threshold is the dividing line between light and darkness,
good and evil, life and death. “Blessed are they
that wash their robes, that they may have the right to
come to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates
into the city. Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers,
and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolators,
and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.”<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c012'><sup>[644]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it is in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures,
at their beginning and at their close. And there are
traces of the same truth in the teachings of the various
religions, and of the more primitive customs and symbolisms.
The all-dividing threshold separates the
within from the without; and a covenant welcome
there gives one a right to enter in through the gates
into the eternal home, to be a partaker of the tree of
life, with its ever-renewing and revivifying fruits.</p>

<p class='c011'>A distinct reference to the proofs of chastity, in the blood-stamped
cloth, is found in the Bible record of the ancient law of
Israel. “If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate
her, and lay shameful things to her charge, and bring up an
evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I
came nigh to her, I found not in her the tokens of virginity:
then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders
of the city in the gate: and the damsel’s father shall say unto
the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he
hateth her; and, lo, he hath laid shameful things to her
charge, saying, I found not in thy daughter the tokens of virginity;
and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity.
And they shall spread the garment [or cloth, Hebrew <em>simlah</em>]
before the elders of the city.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>“And the elders of that city shall take the man and chastise
him; and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of
silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he
hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she
shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. But
if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were not found
in the damsel: then they shall bring out the damsel to the doors
of her father’s house, and the men of the city shall stone her
with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in
Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house.”<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c012'><sup>[667]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>Referring to this passage, the Babylonian Talmud (Treatise
Bechoroth, 45 a) quotes Rabbi Eliezer as saying, “Just as a
house has doors, so also a woman has doors.” Others say:
“Just as a house has keys [<em>miphteakh</em>, literally ‘opener’], so
the woman has a key; for it is said (Gen. 30 : 22) ‘God hearkened
to her, and opened [a play upon <em>patakh</em>, ‘to open,’ and
<em>miphteakh</em>, ‘key’] her womb.’” The famous Rabbi Akibah
says: “Just as a house has hinges, so there are hinges to a
wife; for it is written (1 Sam. 4 : 19), ‘She kneeled and gave
birth, for her hinges had turned’ [translating <em>ṣîrîm</em> (or <em>tseereem</em>)
as ‘hinges’ instead of ‘pains’; the word has the former meaning
in Proverbs 26 : 14, ‘As the door turneth upon its hinges,
so doth the sluggard upon his bed.’]”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Talmudic treatise Middâ (Mishna § 2, 5) explains the
different parts of the womb under the metaphors <em>khĕdĕr</em>,
“interior chamber;” <em>pʾrosdôr</em>, “vestibule;” <em>ʿalîyyâ</em>, “upper
story.”<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c012'><sup>[669]</sup></a> Professor Dr. Morris Jastrow, Jr., in citing these metaphors,
suggests that they coincide with the Arabic and Egyptian
custom of using a key in the marriage rite, as described at
page 244.</p>

<p class='c000'>Critics have long puzzled over the seemingly contradictory
uses of the Hebrew word <em>pôth</em> in two places in the Old Testament;
and the connection of “woman” and “door” with the
parts thereof, above suggested, may aid in resolving the difficulty.
At 1 Kings 7 : 50, in a list of the holy vessels of the
house of the Lord, there are mentioned “the hinges (Heb.,
<em>pôthôth</em>), both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy
place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple, of
gold.” At Isaiah 3 : 17 the same word <em>poth</em> is translated “their
secret parts,” in a reference to the humiliation of “the daughters
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>of Zion.” It has been suggested by some that there was a corruption
of the text in Isaiah. (See Delitzsch and Dillmann, in
their commentaries at this place.) Yet in view of the rabbinical
uses of language, the text would seem to be trustworthy.
<em>Pôth</em> is an “opening,” of a <em>woman</em> or of a <em>door</em>. Additional
light is thrown on the use of the term <em>pôth</em> as “opening” and
as “hinge,” or “socket,” when we bear in mind that the hinge
of an Oriental door was a hole, or cavity, or door socket, on
which the door turned, in order to give an opening or entrance.
Often these door sockets were made of metal,–bronze, silver,
or gold.<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c012'><sup>[670]</sup></a> Sometimes the entire thresholds, in which were these
sockets or “basons,” were of metal. If, however, the threshold
was of stone or wood, the socket, or a plate with a depression
in it, was of metal. The <em>pôth</em>, therefore, when referring to
a door, was the metal plate or socket in the threshold on which
the door turned as on a hinge.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is, indeed, possible that the opening or cavity in the ancient
stone or metal threshold was sometimes the bason, or vessel,
into which the covenanting blood was poured.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c012'><sup>[671]</sup></a> In that case,
the correspondence of the opening of the woman, and the
socket of the threshold, would be more obvious. Important
inscriptions are usually found at or around these so-called “door
sockets,” in Babylonian relics; and there is still doubt in many
minds whether these cavities were always hinge sockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>The word “hinges,” or “hangers,” is at the best an inaccurate
and misleading term, as applied to the pivots or
knuckles on which an ancient door swung in its socket. Ancient
doors were not hung on hinges, but they swung on pivots.
Instead of a hinge, there was a knuckle or pintle, with a corresponding
socket, or cavity, or opening, in the threshold or door-sill.
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>Both Gesenius<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c012'><sup>[672]</sup></a> and Stade<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c012'><sup>[673]</sup></a> give “socket” as one of the
meanings of <em>pôth</em>. The plural, <em>pôthoth</em>, of course, refers to
the sockets of two leaves of a double door on one threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Samson was shut in at Gaza by the Philistines, the
double leaves of the city gate were held together by a bar, without
the lifting of which the doors could not be opened. “And
Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid hold
of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts [the upright
stiles, at the bottom of which were the knuckles that turned
in the threshold sockets], and plucked them up, bar [cross-bar
or latch] and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried
them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.”<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c012'><sup>[674]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I have in my possession a bronze door-socket and knuckle of
an ancient gate or door, unearthed from a mound in the vicinity
of Ghuzzeh, the site of ἡ τύχηancient Gaza, that meets this description.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_b_255.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'>In primitive symbolism, as shown in Babylonia, Egypt, and
India, the circle or ring, like this socket, represents woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be interesting, in this connection, to follow out the
meanings and uses of the Greek words πυθμήν (<i>puthmēn</i>), root
φυ (<em>phu</em>); and φλιή (<i>phliē</i>), doorpost, root φλι (<em>phli</em>); compare
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>φλέω (<em>phleō</em>), φίλος (<em>philos</em>). It is evident that the twofold idea
of the threshold of life, and the threshold, or sockets, of the
door, is in the uses of these terms and their derivatives in
earlier and later Greek. But only this suggestion can be made
here.</p>

<p class='c000'>The correspondence of “woman” and “door,” or of “wife”
and “threshold,” in the Arabic, has already been pointed out.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c012'><sup>[675]</sup></a>
A similar suggestion is in Sanskrit terms.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c012'><sup>[676]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Germany, even at the present time, a common term for
“woman” is “woman chamber” (<em><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">frauenzimmer</span></em>), as in Arabic
<em>hareema</em> is a woman, while <em>hareem</em> is the women’s apartment.
A remark attributed to a prominent American clergyman, as
showing the naturalness of the figure of woman as a door, is:
“He who marries a wife opens a door, through which unborn
generations shall troop.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A Chinese character is the representation of “threshold,” of
“door,” and also of “woman.”<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c012'><sup>[677]</sup></a> It is suggested by the lexicographer
that the origin of this character was a small door in a
large gate, as the inner door to the hareem or women’s apartments;
but it seems probable, from the correspondence of this
twofold idea with the primitive thought of woman as the door
of humanity, that the Chinese character must have had an
origin prior to that degree of civilization which recognized such
a classification in household apartments. The combination
of “door” and “border” is another Chinese character<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c012'><sup>[678]</sup></a> that
stands for “threshold” or “door-sill.”<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c012'><sup>[679]</sup></a> Confucius said that this</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>threshold “should not be trodden on when walking through”
the door.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>SYMBOLISM OF THE TWO SEXES.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As showing the antiquity, as well as the universality, of the symbolism
of the two sexes as the source of life, in connection with
reverent worship, an illustration of the ancient Egyptian Book
of the Dead is noteworthy. In a vignette on Chapter CXXV, in
the Papyrus Ani, a worshiper, is represented before the throne
of Osiris, in the Hall of Righteousness, with uplifted hands, in
token of covenant worship, while his offering is a lotus flower,
the symbol of fecundity, laid on the conventional phallus, the
symbol of virility.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c012'><sup>[680]</sup></a> This vignette is reproduced on the cover
of this volume. The lotus flower has the same signification in
Assyria and India as in Egypt.<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c012'><sup>[681]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>The pine cone, which, as the symbol of virility and vitalizing
force, was prominent in the ancient Assyrian sculptures, as also
in the Phenician and Grecian cults,<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c012'><sup>[682]</sup></a> was likewise to be found
in ancient Rome. An enormous bronze pine cone, eleven feet
high, probably older than the Christian era, still ornaments a
fountain in the gardens of the Vatican. Lanciani says: “Pope
Symmachus, who did so much toward the embellishment of
sacred edifices in Rome (between 498 and 514), removed the
pine cone from its ancient place, most probably from Agrippa’s
artificial lake in the Campus Martius, and used it for adorning

<h3 class='c010'>SYMBOLISM OF TREE AND SERPENT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A striking confirmation of the view taken in this work of the
symbolism of the serpent, as the nexus between the two sexes,
the female being represented by the fig-tree, and the male by
the upright stone, or pole,<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c012'><sup>[686]</sup></a> is found in an ancient religious custom
in Mysore, India. Captain J.S.F. Mackenzie contributed
an interesting paper on this subject to the “Indian Antiquary.”<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c012'><sup>[687]</sup></a>
“Round about Bangalore, more especially towards the Lal
Bagh and <em>Petta</em>,–as the native town is called,–three or more
stones are to be found together, having representations of
serpents carved upon them. These stones are erected always
under the sacred fig-tree by some pious person, whose means
and piety determine the care and finish with which they are
executed. Judging from the number of the stones, the worship
of the serpent appears to be more prevalent in the Bangalore
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>district than in other parts of the province. No priest is
ever in charge of them. There is no objection to men doing
so, but from custom, or for some reason,–perhaps because the
serpent is supposed to confer fertility on barren women,–the
worshiping of the stones, which takes place during the Gauri
feast, is confined to women of all Hindu classes and creeds.
The stones, when properly erected, ought to be on a built-up
stone platform facing the rising sun, and under the shade of
two <em>peepul</em> (<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ficus religiosa</span></em>) trees,–a male and female growing
together, and wedded by ceremonies, in every respect the same
as in the case of human beings,–close by, and growing in the
same platform a nimb (<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">margosa</span></em>) and <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bipatra</span></em> (a kind of wood-apple),
which are supposed to be living witnesses of the marriage.
The expense of performing the marriage ceremony is
too heavy for ordinary persons, and so we generally find only
one <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">peepul</span></em> and a <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nimb</span></em> on the platform. By the common people
these two are supposed to represent man and wife.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>COVENANT OF THRESHOLD-CROSSING.</h3>

<p class='c011'>An American gentleman traveling among the Scandinavian
immigrants in Wisconsin and Minnesota, was surprised to see
their house doors quite generally standing open, as if they had
no need of locks and bolts. He argued from this that they were
an exceptionally honest people, and that they had no fear of
thieves and robbers. A Scandinavian clergyman, being asked
about this, said that they had thieves in that region, but that
thieves would not cross a threshold, or enter a door, with evil
intent, being held back by a superstitious fear of the consequences
of such a violation of the covenant obligation incurred
in passing over the threshold.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked a native Syrian woman, “If a thief wanted to get into
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>your house to steal from you, would he come in at the door, if
he saw that open?” “Oh, no!” she answered, “he would
come in at the window, or would dig in from behind.” “Why
wouldn’t he come in at the door?” I asked. “Because his
<em>reverence</em> would keep him from that,” she said, in evident reference
to the superstitious dread of crossing a threshold with evil
intent,–a dread growing out of an inborn survival of reverence
for the primitive altar, with the sacredness of a covenant entered
into by its crossing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The very term commonly employed in the New Testament
for thieving indicates the “digging through” a building, instead
of entering by the door. “Lay not up for yourselves treasures
upon the earth, where moth and rust doth consume, and where
thieves break through [literally, dig through; Greek, <em>diorussō</em>
and steal.”<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c012'><sup>[688]</sup></a> “If the master of the house had known in what
hour the thief was coming, he would have watched, and not
have left his house to be digged through.”<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c012'><sup>[689]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>Canon Tristram tells of an Adwan shaykh who was proud
of being a “robber,” a “highwayman,” but who resented the
idea that he was a “thief,”–a “sneak thief.” “I am not a
thief,” he said; “I do not dig into the houses of fellaheen in
the night. I would scorn it. I only take by force in the day
time. And, if God gives me strength, shall I not use it?”
Canon Tristram adds: “A ‘thief,’ as distinguished from a
‘robber,’ would never think of attempting to force the door,
but would noiselessly dig through a wall in the rear,–a work
of no great labor, as the walls are generally of earth, or sun-dried
bricks, or, at best, of stone imbedded in turf instead of
in mortar.”<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c012'><sup>[690]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>A former missionary in Palestine<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c012'><sup>[691]</sup></a> says: “Digging through
the wall is the common method pursued by housebreakers in
Palestine, and, save in the cities, the operation is not one of
great difficulty. Windows, in our sense, do not exist in the
houses of the villagers; ... but the walls, built of roughly
broken stones and mud, are easily, and by a skilled hand
almost noiselessly, penetrated. One night, about midnight, I
was driven from my resting-place under a stunted olive-tree
in the plain of Sharon by a terrific thunderstorm, and took
refuge in the miserable fellahy village of Kalansaweh. A
good woman unbarred her door and admitted me to a single
apartment, in which, on the ground level, were several sheep
and cattle, with an ass, and on the higher level a pretty large
family asleep, all dimly discerned by the light of a little oil lamp
stuck in a crevice of the wall. The atmosphere was awful. I
asked why they did not have a window or opening in the wall.
The woman held up her hands in amazement. ‘What!’ she
exclaimed, ‘and assist the robbers [“thieves”]?’... The
robbers [‘thieves’], she explained, were the Arabs in the plain.
Greater rascals do not exist. They were great experts, she
explained, in ‘digging through’ the houses; to put a window
in the wall would only tempt them, and facilitate their work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Now, as of old, among the more primitive pastoral people of
Palestine, “He that entereth not by the door into the fold of
the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief
and a robber.... The thief cometh not, but that he may steal,
and kill, and destroy.”<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c012'><sup>[692]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>I remember now, what I did not realize the meaning of at the
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>time, that while I was journeying in Arabia we did not set a
watch before the entrance of our tents, when we were near a
village; but the guards were at the rear of the tents, to watch
against thieves, who would crawl underneath the canvas to
steal what they might.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seems to have been a custom in medieval times, and
probably earlier, for the besiegers in war time to endeavor to
enter a city which they would sack through a breach in the
walls, or by scaling the walls, rather than by entering the gates.
On the other hand, if a conqueror would protect the inhabitants
of a captured city, he would pass in through the opened gates.
To deliver up the keys of the city gates to a hostile commander
was equivalent to capitulating or making formal terms of surrender.
In the military museum at Berlin are preserved the
keys of cities captured by the emperors of Germany at various
times along the centuries.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is a trace of this custom of besiegers, even in Old
Testament times, in the injunctions to Israel with reference to
its warfares: “When thou drawest nigh unto a city to fight
against it, then proclaim peace unto it [proffer quarter]. And it
shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open [the gates]
unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
therein shall become tributary unto thee, and shall serve thee.
And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: and when the Lord
thy God delivereth it into thine hand, thou shalt smite every
male thereof with the edge of the sword.”<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c012'><sup>[693]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'><a id='olympian' name='olympian'></a>It has been suggested on a former page,<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c012'><sup>[694]</sup></a> but perhaps not sufficiently
explained, that this idea of subjecting one’s self to the
covenant obligations of citizenship by passing through the city
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>gates, over the threshold, had to do with the Grecian custom of
welcoming back to his own city the victor in the Olympian
games through a breach in the walls, instead of through the
gate. The meaning of this Greek custom (continued in Rome)
was not clear in the days of Plutarch, and he, in seeking to
account for it, suggests that it may have been intended to show
that a city having such men among its citizens needed no walls
of defense.<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c012'><sup>[695]</sup></a> But, as they rebuilt their walls after the entrance
of the victor, this explanation is not satisfactory. The world-wide
recognition of the covenant obligations of a passage
through a gate over the threshold is a more satisfactory explanation.
If the victor, on returning in triumph from the
games, were to enter his city through the gates, like any other
citizen, he would be subject to the laws of the city as a citizen
or a guest; but if the city would recognize him as a conqueror,
at home as well as at Olympia, they would let him come in
through a breach in the walls. In this act the citizens nominally
submitted themselves to him; and a city thus entered, and, as
it were, captured, often felt that it received more honor from
its victor than it could confer upon him.<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c012'><sup>[696]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>DOORKEEPER, AND CARRIER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A “porter” and a “porter” are two very different persons,
as the terms are employed in both Europe and America. We
speak of a porter as a menial who carries burdens, such as
parcels or baggage, a mere carrier for hire. Again, we speak of
a porter as the attendant at, or the custodian of, the entrance
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>gate of a mansion or public building. In the one case the
porter is a very humble personage, in the other case he is a
person of responsibility and importance. How it came about
that the same term is applied to both these personages is worth
considering, in view of its bearing on the importance of the
door and the gate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is said to have been a custom of the ancient Etruscans
and Romans, and perhaps of older peoples, in laying out the
foundations of a city, to mark first the compass of the whole
city with a plow. When they came to those places where they
were to have the gates of the city, they took up the plow and
carried it across the gateway, “transported” the plow at that
space. It is said that from this custom the Latin word <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta</span></em>
came to apply to “a gate,” “<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a portando aratrum</span></em>,” “from
carrying the plow,”–<em>porta</em>, in Latin, meaning “to carry.”
Whether or not the traditional custom referred to had a historical
basis, it will be seen that the mere fact of the tradition
will account for the twofold use, in languages derived from the
Latin, of the word “porter” as a carrier, and again as a doorkeeper,
or a gate watcher, or a guardian of the threshold. Apart
from the question of the origin of the terms, we find that the
porter or carrier is one who goes through the gate as the place
of entrance or exit in his carryings; or, again, the porter or
guardian of the gate is one who watches the place of carryings,
and of outgoing and incoming.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the stories told of the founding of Rome by Romulus,
it is said that at the threshold of this enterprise the people
kindled fires before their tents, and then leaped through or
over the flames.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c012'><sup>[697]</sup></a> In connection with this ceremony sacrifices
were offered, and offerings of the first-fruits of forest and field
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>were made to the gods.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c012'><sup>[698]</sup></a> A heifer and a bull were yoked to
the plow, as in symbol of marriage, and afterwards were offered
in sacrifice, thus supplying the symbolic blood on the threshold
of the new city.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c012'><sup>[699]</sup></a> Plutarch, it is true, thinks that, in consequence
of this custom of laying out a city, the walls of a city,
<em>except the gates</em>, were counted sacred; but in this, as in other
matters relating to the threshold,<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c012'><sup>[700]</sup></a> it is evident that Plutarch was
not sure to be correct as to the meaning of archaic customs.</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be force in the suggestion that the two Latin
words, <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta</span></em> and <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">porto</span></em>, like the Greek <em>poros</em>, were derived
from the common Aryan root <em>par</em> or <em>por</em>, “to go,” “to bring
over,” “to pass through.”<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c012'><sup>[701]</sup></a> However this may be, we have
the common English use of the term “port” in words meaning
a door or entrance, and again a carrying or a place of carriage,
as “export,” “import,” “transport,” “portico,” “porthole,”
“portfolio,” etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>An illustration of the twofold use of the word is found in the
word “a portage” or “a carry” as the designation of “a break
in a chain of water communication over which goods, boats,
etc., have to be carried, as from one lake or river to another.”
It is not merely that this is a place where a canoe, or other
luggage, must be carried, but it is the definite “carry” or
“portage,” the bridge, or isthmus, or door, or threshold,<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c012'><sup>[702]</sup></a> by
which they enter another region. This is the common American
use of the term in pioneer life.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c012'><sup>[703]</sup></a></p>

  <span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>PASSING OVER INTO A COVENANT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As these pages are going to press, Dr. Sailer calls my attention
to the phrase
<span class='htmlonly'><span lang="he" xml:lang="he">לעבר בברית</span></span><span class='epubonly'><strong>lʾvr vvrt</strong></span>
<em>laʿabhor bibereeth</em>, to enter,
or pass over, into a covenant. This phrase, as Dr. Driver<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c012'><sup>[704]</sup></a> points
out, is found only in one place, at Deuteronomy 29 : 12. “That
thou shouldest enter [or pass] into the covenant of the Lord thy
God, and into his oath, which the Lord thy God maketh with
thee this day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is evident that here is the idea of passing over a line or
boundary, or threshold limit, into another region, or state or
condition. Until that threshold is crossed, the person is outside
of the covenant with its privileges and benefits; but when
it is crossed, or passed, the person is a partaker of all that is
within.</p>

<p class='c000'>This word <em>ʿabhar</em> corresponds with, while it differs from, the
word <em>pasakh</em>. The two words have, indeed, been counted by
some lexicographers as practically equivalents. Thus Fürst<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c012'><sup>[705]</sup></a>
gives “<em>pasakh</em>=<em>ʿabhar</em>.” In the covenant which Jehovah
makes with Abraham, for himself and his posterity (Gen. 15 :
1–21), when the heifer and the she goat and the ram had been
slaughtered and divided, and the pieces laid over against each
other as two walls, or sides of a door, with the blood probably
poured out on the earth as a threshold between, “a smoking
furnace and a flaming torch,”–representing the divine presence–“passed,”
or covenant-crossed, the blood on the threshold
“between these pieces,” between these fleshly walls or
door-posts of the sacrifice.<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c012'><sup>[706]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>In Jeremiah 34 : 18, the word appears in its twofold signification,
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>in conjunction with a similar double use of the word
<em>karath</em> (“to cut”). Jehovah says, “I will give the men that
have transgressed [<em>ʿabhar</em>, crossed or passed] my covenant, ...
which they made [cut] before me when they cut the calf in twain
and passed [over its blood] between the parts thereof.” Again,
in Amos 7 : 8, Jehovah says of his reprobate people, “I will not
again pass by [<em>ʿabhar</em>] them [covenant-cross them] any more.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There seems to be a trace of this cross-over, or pass-over,
covenant idea in the references to the passing through the fire
in the worship of false gods, as at 2 Kings 16 : 3, where King
Ahaz is said to have “walked in the way of the kings of Israel,
yea, and made his son to pass through [<em>ʿʿabhar</em>] the fire, according
to the abominations of the heathen.”<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c012'><sup>[707]</sup></a> It is evident
that this passing through the fire in honor of a false god was
not the being thrown into the fire as a burnt offering; for such
sacrifices are referred to by themselves, as at Deuteronomy 12 :
31, where it is said of the people of Jehovah that “even their
sons and their daughters do they burn [<em>saraph</em>] in the fire to
their gods.”<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c012'><sup>[708]</sup></a> In the same chapter of 2 Kings (17 : 17, 31) the
two phrases of causing children to “pass through” the fire,
and of “burning” children in the fire, are separately referred
to, in illustration of the fact that they are not one and the same
thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has already been shown<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c012'><sup>[709]</sup></a> that jumping across, or being
lifted over, a fire, at the threshold, is an ancient mode of covenanting,
still surviving in many marriage or other customs;
and that the blood of both human and substitute sacrifices has
often been poured out at the same primitive altar.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>Under the figure of a marriage covenant Jehovah speaks, in
Ezekiel 16 : 8, of entering into a covenant, when he takes the
virgin Israel as his bride: “Yea, I sware unto thee, and entered
into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God, and thou becamest
mine.” Here the more common word <em>bo</em> is used for the
idea of entering; but its connection with the covenant of marriage
would seem to connect it, like the other words, <em>pasach</em>
and <em>ʿabhar</em>, with the thought of crossing over the threshold or
barrier into a new state.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ENGLAND’S CORONATION STONE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>A notable survival of the primitive reverence for the one
foundation, or the original threshold, as the earliest place of
sacrifice and covenanting,<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c012'><sup>[710]</sup></a> is shown in the famous “Coronation
Stone” in Westminster Abbey. This stone is under the chair
in which all the sovereigns of England from Edward I. to
Victoria have been crowned. It was brought by Edward I. to
England from Scone, the coronation seat of the kings of Scotland.
The legend attached to it was that it was the stone
pillar on which Jacob rested at Bethel,–the House of God
where Abraham worshiped, and where Jacob covenanted with
God for all his generations.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c012'><sup>[711]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>“In it, or upon it, the Kings of Scotland were placed by the
Earls of Fife. From it Scone became the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">‘<em>sedis principalis</em>’</span> of
Scotland, and the kingdom of Scotland the kingdom of Scone.”
Since the days of Edward I., it has never been removed from
Westminster Abbey, except when Cromwell was installed as
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>Lord Protector in Westminster Hall, on which occasion it was
brought out in order that he might be placed on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>As in ancient Babylonia, in Egypt, in Syria, in India, in
China, in Arabia, in Greece, in Scandinavia, the one primitive
foundation was deemed the only foundation on which to build
securely with Divine approval, so in the very center of the
highest modern civilization the reputed foundation stone of the
kingdom of the “Father of the Faithful” is deemed the only
secure coronation, or installation, seat of King, Queen, or Lord
Protector. Is it not reasonable to suppose that this feeling has
a basis in primitive religious convictions and customs?</p>

<p class='c000'>Dean Stanley, referring to this Coronation Stone as “probably
the chief object of attraction to the innumerable visitors to
the Abbey,” says of it: “It is the one primeval monument
which binds together the whole Empire. The iron rings, the
battered surface, the crack which has all but rent its solid mass
asunder, bear witness to its long migrations. It is thus embedded
in the heart of the English monarchy–an element of
poetic, patriarchal, heathen times, which, like Araunah’s rocky
threshing-floor in the midst of the Temple of Solomon, carries
back our thoughts to races and customs now almost extinct; a
link which unites the Throne of England to the traditions of
Tara and Iona, and connects the charm of our complex civilization
with the forces of our mother earth,–the stocks and
stones of savage nature.”<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c012'><sup>[712]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Before their publishing, the proof-sheets of this volume were
submitted to a number of prominent scholars in Europe and
America, for their examination and comment, in order to
ascertain if the main thought of the work seemed justified by
the facts known to them in their several special fields of knowledge
and study. Some of the opinions and suggestions of these
scholars as given herewith will have deservedly, in the eyes of
many readers, a weight and value beyond anything that could
be said by the author of this work.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM THE REV. DR. MARCUS JASTROW.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As a Jewish clergyman, and as a conservative Bible scholar,
the Rev. Dr. Jastrow is honored on both sides of the Atlantic
for his special attainments in Talmudic and Rabbinical lore.
His great work, “A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud
Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature,” is
a monument of his learning and ability in these fields. He
writes:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have read your interesting work, ‘The Threshold Covenant,’
<span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>with great attention, and derived from it more information
than I can possibly thank you for.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As I am unable to form an independent opinion on the bearing
of your evidences on the thesis of your work, I can refer
only to those parts of it which treat of Jewish customs and ideas,
and, here, I feel it a privilege to be permitted to say that I
admire your ingenious conception of the passover covenant in
Egypt. Especially interesting, and undoubtedly correct, is your
interpretation of Exodus 12 : 23, according to which the Lord
passes over the threshold in order to visit the Israelitish house,
and will not allow the destroyer to enter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may not be out of place here to direct your attention to
a passage in Talmud Yerushalmi, Aboda Zara III, 42 d, where it
is said about the Philistines: ‘They revered the threshold (<em>miftan</em>)
more than the Dagon,’ to which is added, ‘All other nations
made (worshiped) only one <em>miftan</em>, but the Israelites made
many <em>miftanoth</em>,’ which explains the verse, ‘And I will visit
punishment on him who leaps, and on the <em>miftan</em>’ (Zeph. 1 : 9).
You will observe that the Talmud quotes the verse different
from the Massoretic text, which reads, ‘on every one who leaps
over the <em>miftan</em>.’ I am unable to decide whether the deviation
from the Massoretic text is owing to a different text before the
Talmudic authority under consideration, or merely to a slip of
memory, such as often occurs with those who quote from
memory.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In Talmud Babli, referring to the Philistines in relation
to the Dagon, it is said: ‘They let alone the Dagon and worshiped
the <em>miftan</em>, for they said, His prince (genius) has
abandoned the Dagon and has come to sit on the <em>miftan</em>.’ All
of which proves that there lingered yet in the memory of the
Talmudists the traditional recollection of <em>miftan</em> worship.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. HERMAN V. HILPRECHT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Oldest among civilizations of which we have any sure record
is that of Babylonia. Among the foremost scholars in that
realm is Dr. Hilprecht, formerly of the University of Erlangen,
and now Professor of Assyriology in the University of Pennsylvania.
His prominence is recognized in Europe as fully as
in America. His labors, in the field and in the study, in connection
with the successful Babylonian Expedition of the University
of Pennsylvania, and his monumental work, still in
course of publication, on the Cuneiform Texts brought to light
by that expedition, have added to his reputation on both sides
of the ocean, and confirmed his high standing among the
best scholars of the world in his special department of
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was while on his way to Constantinople, to examine the
latest “finds” in Babylonia brought to the Imperial Museum
there, with which museum Professor Hilprecht has an official
connection, that he examined the proof-sheets of “The Threshold
Covenant.” Of the work in its entirety he writes in generous
appreciation as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your latest book, ‘The Threshold Covenant,’ accompanied
me on my trip to Constantinople. Before we had crossed the
Atlantic I had studied it three times from beginning to end.
I take the first opportunity, at Southampton, to send you these
lines, in order to express to you my full appreciation of what
you have offered to the scientific world in your magnificent
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If in your former book, ‘The Blood Covenant,’ you made
[as was suggested by an eminent German theologian] the
first successful attempt to write a theology of the blood, you
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>have given us in your most recent work a thorough investigation
on the significance and history of the primitive altar upon
which blood was shed by men entering into a covenant with
God or their fellow-men. Surely your two books ‘The Blood
Covenant,’ and ‘The Threshold Covenant’ belong together,
and should therefore be studied together. One supplements
the other, and the former furnishes the key to a full understanding
of the facts presented in the latter; and so again on
the other side.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It must have cost you decenniums to gather all the material
which you lay before the reader in such a systematic form. All
the nations of the world, civilized and uncivilized, ancient and
modern, seem to have contributed their share to your stately
structure, which has my full admiration. Viewed in this light
alone, your book will always prove a regular storehouse of
knowledge for students of primitive rites and religions, and of
various other kindred subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is, of course, impossible for any specialist in one certain
line to fully estimate the hundreds of new features presented in
your recent work. It would be bold on my part, at least, to
express an opinion on questions with which I am not entirely
familiar. As, however, you treat facts which bear closely upon
my special line of investigation,–the oldest history, languages,
and civilization of the Euphrates valley, and of their rites
in general,–I can heartily assure you that, according to my
examination, you have proved your main points beyond question.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is first of all sure that you are the first who fully recognized,
and in fact rediscovered, the world-wide importance
and fundamental significance of the threshold in all ancient
religions. You have re-established an ancient rite which was
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>practically entirely forgotten by modern scholars. By restoring
the threshold to its proper place in primitive religions, you have
rendered a great service to comparative religion, archeology,
and even philology. Many a statement by ancient writers was
obscure to us, many a word puzzling as to its original etymology
and significance, and not a few facts brought to light by recent
excavations remained incoherent and mysterious, because we
had lost sight of the significance of the threshold, which, very
appropriately, you style the first altar of the human race.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In reading your book I could not help wondering that all
these combinations which appear quite clear and plausible now
were not made a long while ago by other investigators. The
earliest inscribed monuments of ancient Babylonia, dating from
the fifth millennium before Christ, are door-sockets which bear
ample witness to the correctness of your theory. Professor
Hommel’s recent ingenious analysis of the Assyrian word
for “to pray,” which was a result of his study of your
‘Threshold Covenant,’ is one of the strongest evidences in
favor of your arguments. Our own recent excavations of the
lowest strata of the temple of Bêl in Nippur, which takes us
back to 7000 B.C., testify in the same direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of the greatest importance for the study of the Old Testament
religion is your doubtless correct explanation of the Passover.
It is entirely in harmony with ancient customs, with
philology, and with common sense. According to the old interpretation
this rite hangs, so to speak, in the air, without any
connection, and yet we know from many other instances that
Old Testament rites of the Hebrews stand in the closest possible
connection with those practiced by surrounding nations.
In the light of your investigations I regard it as an established
fact, and as one of the chief results of your labors, that Jehovah
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>in entering into covenant with his ‘bride Israel’ did not invent
a new rite, but took one with which his chosen people were
already familiar, and gave to it a new and deeper significance
in its new use and relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your final chapter, ‘Outgrowths and Perversions of this
Rite,’ is likewise full of thought and new suggestions. One
cannot help wishing you might have gone beyond the scope of
your book and expressed yourself more in detail as to the precise
connection in which tree and phallus worship stand to the
threshold in each of the principal ancient religions, and what
<em>rôle</em> the snake played in the further development or determination
of the primitive rite so excellently discussed by you. There
is no doubt in my mind that all these different rites, however
independent of each other they may appear in later times, are
but different outgrowths of the same original root and later perversions
of original uplifting thought,–search for unity between
men and God. But as you yourself have given only brief indications
of this, I wisely abstain from entering into details.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Permit me to congratulate you upon the completion of a
work which, in the nature of things, must attract the general
attention of scholars. Whatever may be the interpretation of
certain details contained in your book, the one fact remains
sure: it will always be your great merit to have penetrated into
the long-forgotten secrets of one of the most ancient rites of
humanity, and, by pointing out its great importance for and its
connection with other rites, to have constructed a solid basis
for further investigations, and to have put loose facts together,
and given them a well-defined place in a regular system.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is undoubtedly true that the fresh material from the excavations
at Nippur will furnish additional illustrations of the main
thesis of this work. Dr. Hilprecht will be sure to note these.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. FRITZ HOMMEL.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>As an Arabist as well as an Assyriologist, and as a bright
thinker and learned scholar, in various departments of knowledge,
Dr. Fritz Hommel, Professor of Semitic Languages in
the University of Munich, has a deservedly high standing.
His great illustrated “History of Babylonia and Assyria” is a
marvelous treasure-house of information concerning the history
of the earlier civilizations of the East; and his later studies in
connection with the researches of Dr. Edward Glaser in South
Arabia have poured a flood of light on the influence of ancient
Arabia in the Oriental world. In the realm of Semitic philology
Dr. Hommel is acute minded, and peculiarly alert and suggestive.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having read the earlier pages of “The Threshold Covenant,”
Professor Hommel wrote briefly of his interest in the main
thought of the work, and promised further comments when he
has completed its examination. The necessity of putting these
pages to press forbids the waiting for his valued conclusions.
His first comments are:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am now reading with great interest the proof-sheets of
your new book, which you were kind enough to send me.
Although at this moment overburdened with other work, I
have already got as far as page 70, and hope in the course of a
fortnight to be able to send you my judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To page 60 I wish now to note that already in the time of
Hammurabi disputes were settled at the <em>gate</em>, and, indeed, of
the gate of the temple. See Strassmaier’s Warka Tablets, 30
(B. 57) in Meissner’s <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beiträze zum Altbabylonischen Privatrecht</span></cite>,
p. 42 f.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An interesting discovery, of which perhaps you still may
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>make use, I made yesterday. It is that the Babylonian <em>suppû</em>
(‘to pray,’ ‘to entreat’) is originally merely the verb formed
from the noun <em>sippu</em>, ‘a threshold.’ The first sense, indeed, of
<em>suppû</em> is ‘to sacrifice,’ because that was done at the threshold.
To find a parallel for this transference from the meaning ‘to
offer’ to the meaning ‘to pray,’ compare the Arabic <em>‘ătără</em>,
to sacrifice,’ with the Hebrew <em>‘ātăr</em>, to pray.’<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c012'><sup>[713]</sup></a> To this discovery
I, of course, came through your deductions with regard to the
importance of the threshold.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. A.H. SAYCE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>No Oriental scholar and archeologist is more widely known
in Europe and America, and beyond, or is surer of a hearing
on any subject of which he writes, from both those who agree
and those who differ with him, than Professor Sayce of Oxford
University. The numerous published works of Professor
Sayce have made him extensively known among scholars, and
popularly. Prominent among these are the Hibbert Lectures
on “The Religion of the Ancient Babylonians,” “The Ancient
Empires of the East,” “Fresh Light from Ancient
Monuments,” “The Life and Times of Isaiah,” “The Hittites,”
“Patriarchal Palestine,” and “The Egypt of the Hebrews.”
He now writes from Luxor, in Egypt, while passing
the winter, as usual, on the Nile, in his dahabiyeh Istar:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand thanks for the advance sheets of ‘The Threshold
Covenant.’ Like all your work, it is brimful of accurate
knowledge and new points of view, and is written so charmingly
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>that a child could understand and follow you. I need
not say I have been devouring the pages and admiring their
wealth of references. While I read, you carried me along with
you, and, if you had asked my opinion as I went on, I should
have said that you had made out your case step by step. But
now that I come to look back upon the work as a whole, the
skeptical side of my nature comes uppermost, and I have an
uneasy feeling that the proof is too complete. That you have
made out your case to a large extent is clear, but whether
allowance ought not to be made for other elements is not so
clear to me. Human nature is complex, and we still know so
little about the early history of civilized man! And between
civilized and uncivilized man the gulf seems to have always
been as great as it is today.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. W. MAX MÜLLER.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As an Egyptologist, Professor Müller is recognized for his
scholarship and learning on both sides of the Atlantic. A
favorite pupil of Georg Ebers, he continued his studies at the
University of Berlin under Adolf Erman, and soon made a
mark for himself. His <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Asien und Europa nach Altägypt
Denkmaller</span></cite>,–“Asia and Europe from the Egyptian Monuments,”–at
once gave him high standing in that field. Expressing
his regret that he was not able to give more time to
the examination of “The Threshold Covenant” in its proof-sheets,
he says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You did not hear from me earlier because my too close
occupation prevented my studying your book as thoroughly as
I wished, and contributing, as I hoped to, something on the
threshold question. Even now I have to write hastily.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>“I have found your book most interesting and suggestive, so
that I heartily recommend its publication. I hope to be able
to read it more carefully, and to give a more detailed criticism,
after a while.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A few remarks:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Page 103.–<em>Per-ao</em> [Pharaoh]–gate, door. Not to be
proved. Strangely, the root <em>pire</em> means ‘to go out.’ Originally
<em>pr</em> may have been ‘door,’ but not in historic times.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Page 161.–[Calling the region of Sinai, the ‘land of God’.]
A mistake! The ‘land of God’ is only the land on the Red
Sea. No such records known of Mt. Sinai.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Page 180, line 5.–[A memorial stone spoken of as marking
the boundary line.] How do you know it was a boundary
stone?</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is rich material of better and earlier passages on
boundary stones than that given on page 180.</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>El gisr</em> means ‘bridge.’ The dictionaries do not give
‘threshold.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Page 184.–Sinai, an ‘Egyptian boundary line’? Still
less did the ‘holy mountain’ (p. 185) ever mark the southern
frontier. The threshold sacrifices are evidently a mistake.
But I do not have at hand Brugsch’s book–a very fanciful and
unreliable book.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope that as soon as a very pressing work has been finished,
I shall be able to revise all your passages bearing on
Egypt. But even if I should find some more of these minor
faults, they would not change the good general impression of
the book.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen that none of the points questioned by Professor
Müller are vital to the main thesis of the book, or essential
to its illustration of the prevalence of the threshold
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>covenant customs in Egypt. Moreover, it will be observed,
by a reference to my authorities at the pages mentioned, that
the facts and opinions I have presented at these points are
on the authority of Brugsch Bey and other scholars. The
scholarship of Professor Müller, of course, gives him the right
to question the testimony of any other Egyptologist.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the boundary line of Egypt in the Sinaitic peninsula,
that simply refers to the famous tablet and inscription, in
Wady Maghara, of Snefru, the great king of the fourth dynasty,
when he had first extended his dominions thus far.<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c012'><sup>[714]</sup></a> What was
then Egypt’s boundary line of conquest in that direction may,
indeed, not have continued to be so. The same may be said
of the southern boundary of Egypt on the Nubian frontier.<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c012'><sup>[715]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c000'>My reasons for giving “the threshold” as a meaning of
<em>el gisr</em> are to be found in full in my “Kadesh-barnea,” at pages
50, 339, 341 f.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be noted that Professor Müller had already pointed
out to me the existence of a temple at Thebes bearing the name
of the “Silver Threshold,”<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c012'><sup>[716]</sup></a> after the days of the eighteenth
dynasty. He promises other notes in this direction when he
has time for further research.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. C.P. TIELE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As an Orientalist, and as a student of religions, Professor
Tiele, Professor of the History of Religions in the University
of Leyden, has a position of eminence before the world. His
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>publications of importance are numerous, prominent among
which stand “The Religion of Zarathustra [Zoroaster];”
“Comparative History of the Egyptian and Mesopotamian
Religions;” “The Place of the Religions of Savages in the
History of Religion;” “History of Religions of Antiquity to
the Time of Alexander the Great;” and “Babylonian-Assyrian
History.” A word from Professor Tiele, on the theme
of this book, has exceptional weight. He says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thank you very much for your kindness in sending me
your most interesting book, ‘The Threshold Covenant.’... As
far as I can judge, you have not only given a clear exposition of
the facts pertaining to this widespread custom, but you have
also shown the right way to catch the meaning underlying
those strange usances.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of late I have been mostly occupied by the study of the
religions of civilized people; nevertheless, I ever take a
lively interest in the study of primitive man and the origin of
religious rites. I have to say something on these questions in
the Gifford Lectures, which I have been invited to deliver
before the University of Edinburgh next term. So your book
came just in time to know your meaning on the subject, and to
revise my opinion by comparing it with yours.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. E. WASHBURN HOPKINS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The successor, at Yale University, of Professor William D.
Whitney, in the chair of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology,
is Professor E. Washburn Hopkins, who before held the same
chair in Bryn Mawr College. This fact in itself is an indication
of his position as a scholar; and his latest work, “The
Religions of India,” in the series of “Handbooks on the History
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>of Religions,” bears testimony to his learning and ability
in that realm. Of the matters treated in this volume he says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have read your ‘Threshold Covenant’ with great interest
and pleasure. The statements made in respect of Hindu rites
all appear to me to be correct, and some of them might be
made stronger, notably in the case of the functions of the altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot say that I agree with you in all respects in your
inductions from the ceremonial of the Door, but I have at least
been furnished with much food for reflection and hints for
observation in future investigation on these lines. Your work
is a storehouse of useful data, and illustrates many strange
customs of India by parallels from other countries, though I
should hesitate to refer so much to one primitive principle.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, at all events, the facts of the religious phase which
you emphasize have been set forth clearly, correctly, and fully,
as regards India, to whatever conclusion they may point. I
have had great pleasure in following your argument through
to the end.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be mentioned that the added facts as to the Door,
given in the Appendix, were not in the proof-sheets submitted
to Professor Hopkins.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM THE REV. DR. WILLIAM ELLIOT GRIFFIS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>No American scholar is better fitted than the Rev. Dr. William
Elliot Griffis to speak of Japanese manners and customs,
and of the religions and modes of thought of the people of
Japan. After an extended residence in that country in connection
with the Imperial University of Tokio, he has studied and
written of it and of its inhabitants. “The Mikado’s Empire,”
“The Religions of Japan,” “Japan in History, Folk Lore,
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>and Art,” are among the best known and most valuable of his
works in that field. Of “The Threshold Covenant” he says
heartily, after an examination of its pages:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your general theory is abundantly confirmed in the early
life and customs of Chinese Asia, and especially in the history
of early Japan. I should, of course, be glad to call together a
council of native Japanese friends, and some of my returned
countrymen, and talk over your book, but this is impossible at
present, and press of many duties prevents me from doing
justice to the work, as I should like to do. Such observations
as I may throw out, though imperfect, will, I trust, be suggestive.
I have read the book twice, and consider it a work of
the first order of value.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In mediæval and modern Japan, it must be remembered,
many of the ancient customs and primitive native ideas have
been not only changed, but obliterated, by Buddhism, which,
by its excessive reverence for life, put an end to those customs
which had in them the shedding of blood, or the taking of life.
In ancient days it was the pretty nearly universal custom to
build human beings alive in the walls of castles or strongholds,
and the piers or foundations of bridges. Many are the places
rich in traditions of the <em>hito-gashira</em>, or human pillars, who
were lowered into the sea to be drowned (to appease the dragon,
etc.), or made, as it were, cement for the foundation-stone,–to
which I have alluded in my ‘Religions of Japan.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“What may be called the ‘gate etiquette’ in Japan is elaborate
and detailed. More than once have the foreign teachers,
denizens, and tourists, had quarrels with the Japanese school,
municipal, and national authorities, because they unwittingly
often violated ancient Japanese traditions and customs. I myself
remember how the <em>mom-ban</em>, or gate-keeper, used to refuse
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>admittance to my <em>jin-riki-sha</em> because I had sitting with me a
Japanese student or lad, who could not, in native ideas of propriety,
share with me (a guest) the honor of riding inside the
chief gate of mansion or college. Concerning troubles with
native servants and others, who were inclined to shelter themselves
under the foreigners’ prestige and privilege, I need not
speak in detail. The term ‘Mikado,’ as you may know, is
literally Sublime Porte, Awful Gate, or Portal of Majesty. I
believe there is profound significance in the idea of having
the gateway to a Buddhist temple a structure which is in many
cases almost as imposing as the sacred edifice itself. Each
Shintō shrine has before it, at some distance, a <em>tori-i</em>; and every
little wayside shrine, in size from a doll-house to a one-room
cottage, has almost invariably a little <em>tori-i</em>, or gateway, before
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The most elaborate ceremonies and gradations of honor are
connected with the threshold of the Imperial Palace, and for a
thousand years or more were rigorously observed in Kioto, and
doubtless to great extent are yet in the new palace in Tokio.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In a Japanese marriage, when conducted on the old order
of ceremonies, the origin of which goes back into primeval
twilight, the bride goes from her own home always to be married
in her husband’s home and to become a part of it. As she
approaches her new home, fires are lighted on either side of
the threshold or door of entrance of the bridegroom’s house.
The name of these fires is ‘garden torches.’ As she proceeds
up the corridor, inside the house, two pairs of men and
women, one on each side, have mortars in which they pound
rice. As the palanquin passes, the two mortars are moved
together, and the meal from the two is mixed so as to become
one mess. During the same time two candles have been
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>lighted on either side of the passage way, and after the passing
of the palanquin, the two flames are first joined in one and
then blown out. Of course, these ceremonies are <em>now</em> used
only among the higher classes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In all the Buddhist temples beside the great gateway and
the ordinary temple entrance there is a distinctly marked sill,
behind which is the altar, and over which the worshiper must
not come.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am very much inclined to believe that there is a significance
which allies itself to ‘The Threshold Covenant’ in the
<em>ye-bumi</em> or ‘trampling on the cross,’ observed during the
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries in Japan
in order to eradicate all traces of Christianity. The pagan
authorities made a copper engraving of the crucifix, and putting
it on the ground, between a structure that was evidently
meant for the doorway with a threshold under it, they compelled
every one–man, woman, and child–to step upon the
figure of Christ and the cross in token of their rejection of
everything belonging to Christianity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In ancient Japan, and all through her history, great care was
taken with boundaries and boundary marks, the latter being
sometimes masses of charcoal buried in the earth, or inscribed
pillars, the bases of which were charred. Mr. Ernest Satow, the
first authority on things Japanese, believes that these boundary
pillars, which, in some cases (as in Corea today), were carved
to represent certain gods, afterwards became phallic emblems.
Before most of the Buddhist temples of importance are to be
found the two guardian deities Ni-ō (two kings), and before
many thousands of shrines of both Shintō and Buddhism is
the <em>ama-inu</em> (heavenly dogs), which are the guardians of the
entrance to the temple.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>“Time would fail me to tell of the various fetiches placed over
and beside the doorways and gates. Beside the very elaborate
New Year’s symbolism signifying prosperity, longevity, congratulations,
etc., there is always, on the last night of the year,
a sort of ‘purging out of the old leaven,’ cleaning up of the
house, and exorcism, by means of beans as projectiles, of all
evil and evil spirits. Then bunches of thorny leaves, like
holly, are affixed outside on the door lintel. Over the doorway
of almost every house of country folk and many of the
townspeople, one can see the wooden charms nailed up.
These are bought in the temples of the priests as well as the
packages of sacred paper with Sanskrit letters or monograms
for the better class of houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Besides the red cord with which almost every present in
Japan is tied, the stamp of the red hand on or at the side of the
door, either on the wood itself or on a sheet of paper, nailed
up beside the door, is very common at particular times.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Mecca of Japanese Shintō is at Isé, where the temples
have had from time immemorial ‘only one foundation.’ The
buildings are renewed every twenty years on the same spot.
For many centuries it has been the custom to rebuild Buddhist
temples on the same foundation when destroyed by fire, or
when ‘captured’ from Shintoist to Buddhist ownership....</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me call your attention to the idea underlying the political
and religious covenant of the great Iroquois Confederacy–the
most remarkable political structure of North American Indian
life. The five tribes (later a sixth was added) called their
dwelling-place in New York, between Niagara and the Hudson
‘the Long House’ after the typical Iroquois dwelling in which
lived many families. Few Iroquois lived east of Schenectady,
though they went to fish in the Hudson River, which they
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>then named (a) ‘Schenectady.’ Schenectady (which in the
Indian conception was the region in their extreme east) means,
when analyzed, ‘just outside the threshold,’ or ‘without the
door.’ While Onondaga was the central fore-place of the
Confederacy, the site of Schenectady had special sacredness in
the minds of the Iroquois, and the Mohawks, who occupied
this portion of the country, were called ‘the guardians of the
threshold.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Van Curler (Arendt Van Curler), one of the real ‘makers of
America,’ who knew the Indians so well, and who made that
great covenant with them which kept the Iroquois, despite all
French intrigue, bribery, and opposition, faithful (for two centuries,
till the Revolution divided even the white men), first to
the Dutch, then to the English, knew this Indian reverence for
the threshold, and took a just advantage of it. The fact that
‘The Covenant of Corlear’ was made on the threshold of their
Long House gave it such sacredness in the eyes of the
Indians that it was <em>never broken</em>. In all their later oratory, for
two centuries they referred to this covenant. Besides calling
the governors of New York ‘Corlear’ (the only instance, as
Francis Parkman once wrote me, in which the Indians applied
a <em>personal</em> name instead of making use of a material object,
figuratively, to a governor,–‘fish,’ ‘pen,’ ‘big mountain,’
etc.), the Mohawks of Canada to this day, as I heard them
speak it after personal inquiry, call Queen Victoria ‘Kora
Kowa,’ that is, ‘the great Corlear’ (Van Curler).”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. JOHN P. MAHAFFY.</h3>

<p class='c011'>As an authority in the field of Greek antiquities, as well as
a scholar of wide learning in various other fields, Professor
Mahaffy, of Dublin University, stands in high repute. Among
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>his many published works, in proof of this, are his “Twelve
Lectures on Primitive Civilization,” “Prolegomena to Ancient
History,” “Social Life in Greece from Homer to Menander,”
“Greek Antiquities,” “Rambles and Studies in Greece,”
“Greek Life and Thought from Alexander to the Roman Conquest,”
“The Greek World under Roman Sway,” and “The
Empire of the Ptolemies.” Returning the proof-sheets of
“The Threshold Covenant” to the author, he says generously:
“Your learning is to me quite astonishing, and I could not
venture to criticise you except in a passing way, as I read your
proofs hastily. But you will find [on them] rough notes in
pencil, only to show what I thought at the moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In comment on the custom, in many lands, of carrying out
the dead from a house or a city through a special door or gate,
instead of over the threshold at the principal entrance,<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c012'><sup>[717]</sup></a> he
says: “At present, in the farmhouses about Hoorn, in Holland,
there is a state door opened only for marriages and
funerals. The family use a side or back door only.”<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c012'><sup>[718]</sup></a> Again,
“the ἱερὰ πύλη (<em>hiera pule</em>, ‘sacred gate’) at Athens seems to
have been an accursed gate, through which criminals only were
led out.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In confirmation of the claim that human life, or blood, was
deemed essential in the foundation, or the threshold laying of
a city,<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c012'><sup>[719]</sup></a> Professor Mahaffy says: “Great Hellenistic cities, as,
for instance, Antioch, had a girl sacrificed at their foundation.
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>It was she, apparently, that afterwards appeared as the personification
of the city, ἡ τύχη [<i>hē tuchē</i>, ‘the fortune,’] as it was
called.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ‘red hand of the O’Neills’ is a famous coat-of-arms
well known in Ireland. Lord O’Neill now bears it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As to my assumption that the first hearthstone must have
been, in the nature of things, at the threshold of the cave or
tent or hut, as it still is among primitive peoples, and that the
first stone laid at the corner, or at the doorway, of a house or
building, was, by the very fact of its first laying, the threshold
of that structure, Professor Mahaffy says: “I don’t believe
in the identification of (1) foundation stone, (2) threshold, (3)
house corner, (4) hearthstone, without clear proof.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. WILLIAM A. LAMBERTON.</h3>

<p class='c011'>In Dr. Lamberton, Professor of Greek, and Dean of the
Department of Philosophy, the University of Pennsylvania
has a scholar as acute and discerning in his observations as
he is full and accurate in knowledge in his special field of
classic Greek. He has been familiar with the results of my
researches during my progress of recent years, and he has
this to say, after examining the proof-sheets of the completed
work:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your induction seems to me to be very wide, and to include
in its sweep all phases of civilization, which is practically as
much as to say all periods of human existence, from the most
primitive on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The significance of the threshold as altar, place of covenanting
and worship, in house, temple, and domain, I think is
completely made out.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>“Very striking is the smiting of the blood, as sign of the
covenant relation, upon the posts of the doorway; and in particular
the mark of the red hand. The connection you endeavor
to show between all this and the marriage rite is, to say
the least of it, suggestive. The mystery of the gift and transmission
of life, it has always seemed to me, early struck man;
and that it did not have its issue only in perverted forms, is
clear from the fragmentary glimpses we get into the Eleusinian
mysteries, celebrated in honor of divinities of productivity.
Purification from sin and blessedness in the next world appear
to have been among the hopes of the initiated.</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I call your attention to one or two points? The
Greek word for altar, βωμός (<em>bomos</em>), altar, from root βα (<em>ba</em>),
seen in βαίνειν (<em>bainein</em>), ‘to step.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“May not the whipping of the boys mentioned on page 175
be a misinterpreted substitute for sacrifices at the boundary
posts, perhaps even at one time human sacrifices? Such later
modifications of sacrifice into symbolic whippings are not
unheard of elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Professor Lamberton’s suggestion that the Greek word for
altar has its origin in a “step” has confirmation in the fact,
already noted, that the earliest temples were a shrine at the
summit of a series of steps, as in a step-pyramid, in Babylonia,
Egypt, Canaan, Mexico, Peru, and the South Sea Islands.<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c012'><sup>[720]</sup></a> Is
there not a reference to this ordinary mode of building an altar
among the outside nations, in the divine command to Israel in
the wilderness as to the building of an altar to Jehovah?
“Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
nakedness be not discovered thereon.”<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c012'><sup>[721]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. DANIEL G. BRINTON.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c011'>In the realm of American antiquities, and of anthropology generally,
Dr. Brinton, Professor of American Archæology and
Linguistics in the University of Pennsylvania, stands foremost.
He has been President of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science; and his knowledge and his work
have had marked recognition in the International Oriental
Congresses, in the American Philosophical Society, in the
Academy of Natural Sciences, and in other learned bodies.
He writes:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have gone over, with constantly increasing interest, your
pages on ‘The Threshold Covenant,’ an interest associated
with admiration of the wide reading you have brought to bear
on the theme, and the temperate and enlightened spirit in
which you have presented the facts.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have, without question, established the practical
universality of the rites and ceremonies you describe, and the
ideas from which they took their origin. Your volume is
another and powerful witness to the parallelisms of culture, and
to the unity in the forms of expression of the human mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>“These analogies and identities are, as you well know, open
to several interpretations or explanations. The main one
offered by you seems to me, as a fact, quite probable; certainly
it was constantly associated with such rites.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am not able altogether to agree with the point of view
expressed in your Preface, and on pages 193–195, in reference
to the general origin and trend of religious ideas; but possibly
I should find myself closer to your position were I to see it
more amply defined. I cannot think the earliest religions
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>were, as a rule, more ‘uplifting’ than the later ones; I think
there was a general progress upwards.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM THE REV. DR. EDWARD T. BARTLETT.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Dean Bartlett, of the Divinity School of the Protestant Episcopal
Church of Philadelphia, is prominent as a devout and
careful Bible scholar, who has the confidence of the Christian
community to a rare degree. He was the first president of the
American Institute of Sacred Literature, and he is the vice-president
of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis.
His work, on the “Scriptures Hebrew and Christian,” as an
introduction to the study of the Bible, won for him commendation
from eminent scholars. Having read the proof-sheets of
this book, Dean Bartlett writes:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thank you for the opportunity to read your book ‘The
Threshold Covenant.’ And I also want to thank you for allowing
me to know something of the growth of your thought on
the subject, in the frequent conversations we have had about it
during the years past. Ever since I came into the privilege of
calling you friend I have been a witness of the truth of your
statement in the Preface, that your theory is wholly a result of
induction, that it came to you out of the gathered facts, instead
of the facts being gathered in support of the theory. What I
know as to your method would lead me to expect a result that
must stand, and there are few writers who would be for me as
authoritative as you in matters which I could not verify for
myself. But here you furnish the means of verification.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As the subject has come up between us from time to time
and part by part, I have been led to think over what you told
me, and it has seemed to me that nothing could exceed the
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>care with which you advanced in your induction. And now
that I review the work as a whole, I am convinced that you
have demonstrated your theory. In doing so, you have thrown
a whole flood of new bright light on primitive culture, on some
of the sacredest phases of human life in all ages, on many
places of Scripture from the first chapter to the last, and on the
central sacraments of the Old and New Covenants.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If this light came to me now for the first time in all its
fulness, I am not sure whether I should be startled and almost
blinded by it, or whether I should, at first at least, altogether
fail to appreciate it. But you have been giving it to me gradually
as it came to you, and so I have been in a position to
become adjusted to it, and also to test its illumining quality.
I find that it is not transitory, but permanent, not a flash but a
steady light, in which the great objects of our Christian faith
stand clearly revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I sincerely congratulate you upon the completion of such
an important and illuminating work.”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>FROM PROFESSOR DR. T.K. CHEYNE.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Just as the final pages of this volume are going to press,
a valued communication concerning them is received from
Professor Cheyne, of Oxford University. Professor Cheyne is
Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at
Oxford, and Canon of Rochester. He is well known on both
sides of the Atlantic as a prominent English representative of
the school of modern “higher criticism,” or “historical criticism.”
He was a member of the Old Testament Revision
Company, and he contributed many important articles on
biblical subjects to the ninth edition of the “Encyclopædia
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>Britannica.” In 1889 he delivered the Bampton Lectures on
“The Historical Origin and Religious Ideas of the Psalter,”
and his various works on Old Testament literature, including
Job, the Psalms, Solomon, Isaiah, and Jeremiah, have made
him familiar to English readers the world over. The kindly,
frank, and courteous comments of Professor Cheyne on “The
Threshold Covenant” are the more highly valued in view of
the fact that he has had occasion to suppose that the author’s
standpoint of biblical criticism was not quite the same as his
own. He says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am delighted to have been able to make early acquaintance
with a book so full of facts which really illuminate the
dark places of primitive times. That the explanation of the
Hebrew Scriptures profits much by it, is clear. Thank you for
having devoted so much patient and thoughtful care to the
accumulation and interpretation of the facts. I have never
doubted your singular capacity for archeological work, and
have only regretted that there has not been greater fellow-feeling
with the critics (in the popular sense,–for you, too, are critical,
though not quite in the right sense and to the extent
required, if I may personally say this).</p>

<p class='c000'>“I notice on page 46 f. a reference to the foundation of Jericho
by Hiel. It appears to me that the idea suggested by
archeology is only defensible on the principles generally associated
with ‘historical criticism.’ If this idea is in any way
historically connected with the act of Hiel related in 1 Kings
16 : 34 (wanting in LXX), and pointed to, whether in reality or
in the honest, though faulty, imagination of the writer, in Joshua
6 : 26, we must suppose that the act of Hiel was misunderstood
by the critics of these two passages. For the deaths of Abiram
and Segub are referred to as divine <em>judgments</em> upon Hiel for his
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>violation of the <em>ḥerem</em>, or ban, laid upon the site of Jericho,
whereas, according to the archeological theory, Hiel offered
his children as foundation sacrifices, believing that he could
thus bring a blessing on the city of Jericho. No plain reader
will understand the connection of the archeological idea and
the two passages of Old Testament–as it appears to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The connection has been surmised by others before you,–probably
you can tell me who first struck out the idea. Is it in
Tylor, or where? I cannot remember. Winckler (<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geschichte
Israel</span></cite>, Part I, 1895) expresses his adhesion to it. Kuenen
(Onderzoek, I [1886], p. 233) holds that there was a misunderstanding
of the traditional facts on the part of the author of the
prediction in Joshua 6 : 26 in its present form, and of the
author of the notice in 1 Kings 16 : 34; he thinks that Hiel
sacrificed his two sons, but does not appear to recall the archeological
facts. I think he ought to have recalled them. But he
is right in the main, as it seems to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have no prejudice against archeological illustrations of
customs or of phraseology. On the contrary, I delight in them.
I have for many years been on the archeological side, as well
as on the critical....</p>

<p class='c000'>“Robertson Smith took the right course, at once critical and
archeological. Only he could not do everything, and he purposed
to limit himself, to a great extent, to those branches of
archeology which he knew at first hand, or in which he could
trust the experts. He would not trust the English (biblical)
archeologists, because they were not critical.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you right about (God’s) ‘strong hand,’ etc., page 83?
And what connection has <em>teraphim</em> with <em>threshold</em> (p. 109)?
Bonomi is no critic. You are very convincing about the passover
blood.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>“I will write again if any special notes suggest themselves. A
number of references in the Old Testament and the New Testament
must be open to divers interpretations; <em>but I habitually
act upon your own principles</em>. Phrases which seem to us
simple, are often full of references which archeology alone can
explain. <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Macte esto.</span></em>”</p>

<h3 class='c010'>ADDITIONAL FROM PROFESSOR DR. FRITZ HOMMEL.</h3>

<p class='c011'>Before this Supplement is finally printed, there comes a
second communication from Professor Hommel of Munich,
as already promised by him.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c012'><sup>[722]</sup></a> In this new communication
are suggestions and words of appreciation that will be welcomed
by many readers, as coming from such a source. Professor
Hommel says:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only a few days ago I finished reading your highly interesting
little book, ‘The Threshold Covenant,’ and I hasten to
write to you, that I have read it with ever-increasing interest,
and have learned infinitely much from it. Our views regarding
the high antiquity and the unity of human culture receive
entirely new light through this work; in addition, a large
number of old oriental and biblical ways and customs now
become intelligible and clear.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Manifestly correct, and indeed most happy, is your derivation
of the threshold cult, and of sacrifice in general, from
the first human blood shed on crossing the threshold of
woman; also the important explanation of the signs for life,
which I have compared: Egyptian,
<img class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle; width:auto; height:1.5px;" src="images/i_b_333_egyptian.jpg" alt="" />;
Babylonian,
<img class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle; width:auto; height:1.5px;" src="images/i_b_333_babylonian.jpg" alt="" />.
(Compare
<img class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle; width:auto; height:0.75px;" src="images/i_b_333_vulva.jpg" alt="" />
<em>vulva</em>.) Moreover, your explanation of the
passover is much more satisfactory than taking <em>pesakh</em> in the
sense of ‘to pass by.’</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>“Permit me now to offer a few remarks, of which you may
still be able to avail yourself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With the symbol of the red hand may also be compared
the hands upon the Sabaean bronze tablets (<em>Z.D.M.G.</em>, Vol.
19, plate XI., and especially plate VII.), where fourteen hands
of seven gods are pictured above the inscription. Furthermore,
see Pinches’ Inscribed Babylonian Tablets, belonging to the
collection of Sir Henry Peek, Part III., p. 66; a seal cylinder,
on which appears a raised hand between the god and the
priest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 100 [of your book].–More accurately, I is <em>house</em>
as well as temple; I-GAL is palace (<em>í-gal íkallu</em>); but Hebrew
and Arabic <em>hekal</em> is ‘temple,’ ‘Holy of Holies’ (Hebrew,
also ‘palace’).</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 105.–That the design in question, on the old
Babylonian seal cylinder, represents the sun gates, is a discovery
made by your own countryman, Dr. W. Hayes Ward
(American Journal of Archeology, III., nos. 1–2, p. 52).</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 108.–The Arabic <em>mihrâb</em> is a loan word from
the South Arabic and Ethiopic, <em>mikrâb</em>, temple; literally,
‘praying-place.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 171.–In South Arabic inscriptions <em>wathan</em> signifies
‘boundary-pillar,’ and at the same time ‘statue of god,’
‘idol.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 180.–<em>El gisr</em> is literally ‘bridge.’ The bridge
was also looked upon as a gate, as leading from one shore to
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 229.–Sacred prostitution. Compare Babylonia
<em>kadishtu</em> (literally, holy person), Hebrew <em>kādusha</em>, ‘harlot.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 233 (note).–The Babylonian <em>patânu</em>, ‘to hold the
sacrificial meal,’ ‘to eat,’ <em>naptanu</em>, ‘meal,’ is connected with
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>Hebrew <em>miphtan</em>. I am inclined to believe also that the
Babylonian <em>ʿgish-da=pitnu</em>, really means ‘threshold;’ also
that <em>gish-sa</em>, <em>ush-sa</em>, a bridal gift, is originally ‘threshold.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 234.–The ‘serpent’ of the boundary stone was
originally the Milky Way. The other symbols are animals of
the Zodiac.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 235 (note 3).–Compare, also, Hommel, <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Babylonische
Ursprung der Ægypt. Kultur</span></cite> (fight of Merodach with
the serpent=fight of Rê ‘with ʿApep’).</p>

<p class='c000'>“On page 238.–<em>Nekhushtân</em>, the name the serpent of
Moses, is derived from <span lang="he" xml:lang="he">נחשת</span>, ‘<em>vulva</em>,’ or, at all events, is
related to this word.”</p>

speaking of the prominence in India of the symbolism of the <em>linga</em> and

as a male principle, and Matter, or the germ of the external world,
regarded as a female.” He says: “Without the union of the two no
creation takes place. To any one imbued with these dualistic conceptions
the <em>linga</em> and the <em>yoni</em> are suggestive of no improper ideas. They are
either types of the two mysterious creative forces ... or symbols of one
divine power delegating procreative energy to male and female organisms.
They are mystical representatives, and perhaps the best impersonal representatives,
of the abstract expressions ‘paternity’ and ‘maternity,’” [and
their conjunction in marital union]. (<cite>Brahmanism and Hinduism</cite>,

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r558'>558</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among primitive peoples it was a common thought that the first fruits
of life in any sphere belonged of right to God, or the gods. This was
true of the fields, of the flocks and herds, and of the family. (See, for
example, Frazer’s <cite>Golden Bough</cite>, II., 68–78, 373–384; also W. Robertson
Smith’s <cite>Religion of the Semites</cite>, pp. 443–446.) As in Egypt particular
gods were supposed to have power over men and beasts in special localities,
the first-born belonged to them, and stood as representing their power
and protection; yet Jehovah claimed to be Lord over all. And now, at
the close of the contest between God and the gods, Jehovah took to himself
out of the homes of his enemies the devoted first-born of man and of
beast, in evidence of the truth that the gods of Egypt could not protect
them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r612'>612</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There seems, indeed, to be a connection between the Hebrew words,
<em>miphtan</em>, “threshold,” and <em>pethen</em>, “asp,” “adder,” or “serpent,” as first
pointed out to me by Mr. Montague Cockle. Although the verbal root
is not preserved in the Hebrew, there is no valid reason for doubting that
they go back to the same root. In Arabic, the verb is preserved as
<em>pathana</em>, “to tempt.” Its derivatives indicate the same meaning. This
would seem to confirm the connection of the primitive threshold, the
serpent, and temptation. In Leland’s <cite>Etruscan Roman Remains</cite> (p.
131 f.) are citations from several ancient works, and references to current
Italian traditions, showing the supposed connection of the serpent
with the threshold, the phallus, and married life, that are in obvious confirmation
of the views here expressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Minor errors or inconsistencies of punctuation or formatting have been
corrected silently. There were a number of occasions where
quotation marks were not balanced. Where possible the cited source has
been consulted. It was not always possible to surmise the scope of quoted
material, in which case it is noted below, but unchanged in the text.</p>

<p class='c000'>In at least one case, on p. <a href='#Page_125'>125</a>, the quotation from Ármin Vámbéry’s
<cite>Travels in Central Asia</cite> (see note <a href='#f361'>361</a>) was incorrectly
marked. Quotation marks have been added in order to properly denote those
portions which directly follow the source.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the scriptural index, on p. <a href='#Page_303'>303</a>, the entries for 1 Timothy are
